) . \\nsince that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with it wouldn\\'t be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film , and because it\\'s a party , there are some more main characters , such as : william ( charlie korsmo , finally surfacing after \" dick tracy \" ) , the nerd ( and his dominions ) who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike , who\\'s humiliated him for years , but gets too caught up in drinking to do it ; kenny ( seth green ) , the wigger , who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid ( uh huh ) ; and denise , the only exceptional character , who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom ( don\\'t ask ) with kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile . \\nugh . \\nthe main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not \" american grafitti \" or \" dazed and confused , \" two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers ( not to mention were extremely entertaining ) , but to john hughes films of the 80s , most notably \" sixteen candles . \" \\nthe big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters , and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion . \\nthis film forgets to satirize its characters , and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes . . . and \\nthen says that it\\'s all okay . \\nwe can\\'t take this film seriously , nor can we take this as fun , so really what good is it ? \\nbut i will tell you some things i did like : i liked the direction , except for a couple too-over-the-top features , like way-too-glossy jump cuts ( it\\'s like an oxymoron ) and other obscurities . \\ngenerally , though , elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement , and even manage to capture an altman-esque feel to their film from time to time ( a thing with a note , though , is too hokey to really be admirable ) . \\ni actually did like seth green , for once in about a decade ( when he played a very young woody allen in \" radio days \" ) - his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable . . . almost . \\nand , of course , lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise , the one character we could have used some more of , even though it would have changed the entirety of the film . \\nhowever , the character of denise really doesn\\'t work with the film , when really thought about . \\nshe\\'s far too witty and realized ( at least for the first half ) to belong in this film , and whenever she appears , she automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone . \\nshe\\'s not just the cynic or the intellectual ; she\\'s just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters . \\nshe may ruin the film more , but at least when she\\'s on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves \" well , at least we\\'ll be entertained . \" \\na couple other things that just don\\'t work : mike\\'s character , who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything : too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general ; the aimless , bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda - give me a break ; and perhaps the one thing that just doesn\\'t work at all : jenna eflman\\'s uncredited cameo as an angel - just didn\\'t work , but nice try . \\nbasically the worst thing about this film , the real reason i\\'m giving this such a low rating , is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything we\\'d do . \\nwe don\\'t feel for these characters because for most of us , we aren\\'t stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots . \\nthe acid test for high school movies is : does it at all capture the feel of what it\\'s portraying ? \\nthe answer for this film is no . \\nnice try , though . \\n',\n",

a muffled russian accent , dr . nekhorvich ( rade ) , mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it . \\nhe also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain . \\nwhich explains the film\\'s mythic theme . . . as \\nwe enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil . \\nthe one who played the villain , dougray scott , does so in a one-dimensional gruff tone , which did not distinguish him in that role . \\nat least , if the film got the villain part right , it might have had some fun with this nonsense . \\nsoon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri , but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains . \\nbefore they crash the plane and parachute out of it , the one who was posing as dimitri , turns out to be sean ambrose ( scott ) , a rogue member of the imf , which is a cia-like clone . \\nhe steals the package with the antidote , peels off a latex mask , which is a replica of the hero of the story , ethan hunt ( cruise ) , who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust . \\nsean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices . \\nwe already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face/off and in the original mission impossible , which as convoluted a plot as that film had , it was still a superior film to this sequel . \\nwoo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground , as it is used so often in this film by both sides , so much so , that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain . \\nit makes it seem as if anyone could be another character , which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense . \\nnext we are in a mountain range in the american southwest , and ethan is on vacation , hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool , when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard , delivers via a rocket launcher , a pair of talking sunglasses . \\nhunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help , billy baird ( john polson ) and luther stickell ( ving rhames ) , with luther running a high-gadget computer , but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall ( thandie ) to join his team . \\nhe is told , as an incentive to recruit her , all her criminal charges will be dropped . \\nhopkins then signs off with the tag line : this message will self-destruct in five seconds . \\nactually , with the departure of hopkins , it was this disposable film that actually self-destructed at this point . \\nin seville , hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase , where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of a mountain road . \\nhe also falls for her when this was only supposed to be a business deal , and learns that she is valuable because her ex-boyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to f * ck her . \\nthe imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f * ck him , as she leads them to his hide-out in the seaside of australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort , the south african , hugh stamp ( richard roxburgh ) . \\nrobert towne , the screenwriter , who contributed to the first \" mission , \" who is noted for doing \" chinatown \" -- writes a colorless , pedestrian script , one that fails even to be funny in a camp way . \\nthe terrorists , who aim to rule the world , are interested in owning 51 percent in a biotech company and in getting stock options , as they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote , insuring that they will make billions on the stock . \\nethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah , with his only conflict being who is more important to save first . \\nethan does this rescue against all odds , as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company , fight it out with sean and the other terrorists , and rescue nyah , who injected herself with the virus to hinder sean\\'s getting it , as the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle . \\nethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle , using kick-boxing , winning a shootout , throwing a full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists , making some more use out of that peeling mask bit , and by being completely fearless and larger than life , while he kick\\'s everyone\\'s ass . \\nif i was only entertained by this . . . i \\ncould have lived with it . \\nbut this film was so badly made , that it was like watching a highlight film of a basketball game , seeing only the slam-dunks , but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast . \\nin any case , this is a critic-proof film , and will in all probability do well in the box office , as it was made to appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this one easy to buy into . \\n',\n",

antarctica , this time to be the first to cross the ice-bound continent on foot . \\n28 men set sail on the brigantine endurance and they would not be heard from again for nearly two years . \\ndirector george butler , using film footage and photographs from the historic journey , tells their remarkable story in \" the endurance : shackleton\\'s legendary antarctic expedition . \" \\nthe expedition started out as a merely incredibly difficult quest to traverse , on foot , the vast wasteland of antarctica . \\nas the intrepid ship and crew entered the weddell sea , the entry to the cold , cruel continent , they did not plan on the dense pack ice bringing the voyage to an abrupt halt as the endurance became trapped within sight of land . \\nfor months the ice thickened and compressed until the ship was crushed , stranding the men on the flow , propelling them away from their goal and , eventually , into their lifeboats for safety . \\nshackleton , faced with a desolate situation , made the decision to lead the three tiny boats to the relative safety of uninhabited elephant island . \\nonce on this \" safe \" haven , shackleton next turned his sights to saving his crew and returning them to civilization . \\nhe and five of his men leave the island in an open boat to make the 800 mile journey on the world\\'s roughest sea to get help from the nearest inhabited island of south georgia . \\nmiraculously , the six land , after 17 days at sea , on the uninhabited side of the target island and are forced to trek across treacherous , snow covered mountains , covering 22 miles in just 36 hours . \\nthis ordeal is followed by several attempts by shackleton to get back to elephant island to rescue the remaining crewmen . \\nin the end , he is successful and everyone made it back home alive , only to be swallowed up by the ravages of the war . \\nthe title of this fascinating documentary , \" the endurance , \" is more than just the name of ship that carried the crew of brave men to the edge of the world . \\nit is also the description of the stamina and ability of every one of the men who survived 19-months of the toughest , most grueling conditions on the face of the earth . \\nthe name of the film is a tribute to every member of the crew and to the ship that sheltered them for many month of frigid antarctic weather . \\nit also describes the focused mental state of shackleton who never gave up on himself or his men . \\nwith astonishing foresight , shackleton brought australian cinematographer and photographer frank hurley along on the journey . \\nthe filmed footage and photos are remarkable as they capture the ordeal of the men , day to day life , the affection all felt for their loyal sled dogs , the slow destruction of the endurance and the preparations to get off of the pack ice flow . \\nafter the sinking of the ship , the remaining film stock , with the exception of a still camera and three rolls of film , had to be discarded so the continuing chronicle of the incredible journey gets less photo documentation as the ordeal plods on . \\nconsidering hurley was using relatively primitive photo technology in one of the world\\'s harshest environments and captured so much on film is a feat unto itself . \\n ( hurley created his own account of the shackleton expedition in his 1919 documentary , \" south , \" an interesting companion piece for \" the endurance . \" \\nif shackleton\\'s original idea , document his trek across the frigid southern continent , had been successful , it would have been considered a super human feat . \\nas you watch the story of \" the endurance \" unfold , you realize that the disastrous obstacles the sir ernest and his men faced and overcame were even greater accomplishments than the first intent . \\n ( shackleton\\'s amazing 800-mile journey in an open boat is fodder for a rousing adventure story all by itself . ) \\nthere are a couple of minor nitpicks with this fine work , though . \\nactor liam neeson narrates the story , but his voice is too soft spoken and lilting for the dramatic tale . \\nthe nature of the ordeal also concentrates most of the visual material , both film and photo , in the documentary\\'s first half . \\nas the crew\\'s adventure takes more drastic paths , hurley had less and less film stock available to chronicle the awesome events . \\nhelmer butler and his team fill in the blanks , but the treasure of \" the endurance , \" its film footage , is mostly relegated to the early months of the expedition . \\ni can\\'t think of a true-life adventure that shows , better , the triumph of man over seemingly insurmountable odds . \\n \" the endurance , \" based on caroline alexander\\'s book , is an eye-opening documentary that goes where few men have gone before and , even more remarkably , all 28 survivors lived to tell about it . \\ni give it a b+ . \\n',\n",

              " 'every once in a while , when an exceptional family film comes along , i will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been ; with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children , it is remarkable how many non-disney films disappear in a couple of weeks . \\nnow i see that in so doing , i have unfairly ghettoized these films . \\nso i am issuing my challenge not just to parents , but to anyone who wants to support smart , funny , energetic film-making : see matilda . \\nsee it in a theater , rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video . \\nsee the best film i have seen in 1996 . \\nnot the best children\\'s film . . . the \\nbest film . \\nperiod . \\nbased on a story by roald dahl , it tells of young matilda wormwood ( mara wilson ) , an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have a pair of deeply stupid parents : harry ( danny devito ) , a crooked used car salesman ; and zinnia ( rhea perlman ) , a simple-minded bingo addict . \\nthe wormwoods barely notice matilda exists , and when they do , it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books . \\nwhen they finally do send her to school , it is to crunchem hall , a bleak place run by cruel , child-hating miss agatha trunchbull ( pam ferris ) . \\nbut things begin to look up for matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher , miss honey ( embeth davidtz ) , who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness . \\nmatilda also discovers another special talent -- the ability to move things with her mind -- which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbull\\'s cruelty . \\nit was this spring\\'s james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them , and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda . \\nand just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton , matilda soars on the cock-eyed direction of danny devito . \\ndevito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses , and he contributes some memorable images . \\nin one scene , an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pig-tails and flung through the air like a throwing hammer ; later , an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing a dessert . \\nmatilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale . \\nit is also characteristic of the best children\\'s tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don\\'t realize that they are learning them . \\nthere is a hilarious moment when matilda\\'s television-addicted father snatches away the book she is reading ( in a wicked joke , he thinks _moby dick_ is pornographic ) and forces her to watch an inane game show ( hosted by jon lovitz ) in which contestants are smeared with adhesive and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing around . \\nmatilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment , and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child -- that because \" i\\'m big and you\\'re little , i\\'m right and you\\'re wrong . \" \\nmore specifically , it has as its heroine an intelligent , self-confident girl who struggles successfully against other people\\'s notions of how she should behave . \\nit is no coincidence that matilda was co-written by robin swicord , who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women . \\nfinally , matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment : it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word . \\ndevito knows enough to make matilda fast-paced and appealing to children , taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy , including a great chase through her dark house . \\nthe child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable , with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character . \\nbut there are also many , many delights for adults , including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matilda\\'s classmates recite in sing-song fashion ; there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matilda\\'s father . \\ni can\\'t imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted . \\nmatilda is a film which left me glowing with good feeling . \\ni will see it again , and years from now i will watch it with my children . \\nand now i will stop , because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin , and there is a seat in that theater you should be in , if you have a child or ever were a child . \\n',\n",

\\nfilm makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else , and that\\'s why there\\'s no shortage of movies about this subject . \\nthe best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski , who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance . \\nthese themes weave their way through many of his movies , including decalogue , the double life of veronique , and the triptych of blue , white , and red . \\nhowever , they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance , where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action ( missing or catching a train ) changes the course of his life . \\nin his autobiography , kieslowski on kieslowski , the director describes his attraction to the concept this way : \" [the idea is] rich and interesting ? that every day we\\'re faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which we\\'re completely unaware . \" \\nwhile this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films ( including , in a way , frank capra\\'s it\\'s a wonderful life ) , sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths . \\nthe \" road not taken \" approach isn\\'t just a plot device , either . \\nwriter/director peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she just misses/catches a train . \\nthe audience watches , with ever-growing fascination , how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life : her future career , where she lives , whom she loves , and whether she has a family . \\nas her separate destinies diverge and then re-converge , she becomes two completely different individuals . \\nthat woman is helen , played by gwyneth paltrow as a long , dark- haired brit . \\none day , after losing her job as an advertising executive , she decides to return home in the middle of the day . \\nthe scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform . \\nin scenario #1 , she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station . \\non board , she meets the cheerful , talkative james ( john hannah ) , a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty . \\nminutes later , in her flat , she walks in on her lover , gerry ( john lynch ) , in bed with another woman ( jeanne tripplehorn ) . \\nin scenario #2 , she misses the train and , shortly thereafter , is the victim of an attempted mugging . \\nshe doesn\\'t meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerry\\'s infidelity . \\njuxtaposed one against the other , while sharing many places , cues , and characters , the two stories proceed in parallel from there . \\non one level , for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate , sliding doors can be viewed as a deep and wonderful experience . \\nbut , for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting , a script with a few twists , and a great deal of genuinely funny material , sliding doors still fits the bill . \\none of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences -- those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures , and those who could care less . \\nit shouldn\\'t come as any surprise that the acting , at least from three of the four leads , is solid . \\npaltrow , who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same , yet gradually become much different , is the standout . \\nshe plays both of her roles effectively and believably -- the shy , insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated , platinum-blond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on a new career with a new man . \\njohn hannah , known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and a funeral , is instantly likable . \\njohn lynch , taking a break from movies about ireland\\'s troubles , does a good job presenting gerry as a inept , selfish philanderer . \\nonly jeanne tripplehorn , who plays an over-the-top vixen , seems out of place . \\nher attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring , and it\\'s occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element . \\none member of the supporting cast deserves special notice . \\ndouglas mcferran , who plays gerry\\'s best friend , russell , is an absolute delight , stealing every scene that he\\'s in . \\npart of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie . \\non one occasion , he has a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into a life of monogamy . \\non another occasion , while laughing at gerry\\'s plight with the women in his life , he comments , \" being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable . \" \\nbut it\\'s not all in the dialogue . \\nmcferran tears into this part with relish ; his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of a top-notch comedy . \\nthis is the first feature film for peter howitt , and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb . \\nthe script is shrewd and inventive , combining wit , romance , and intelligent melodrama into a crowd-pleasing whole . \\nsliding doors grants more than just a good time at the movies , however . \\nfor those who are so inclined , its central theme offers an opportunity to ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe -- all while having a good time . \\n',\n",

              " 'i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of \" good will hunting \" , based both on the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the film , in which the main character will hunting ( matt damon ) , an mit janitor in his early twenties , is discovered to be an einstein-level closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight . \\nthe only problem is that will is a tough street kid who\\'s had his share of run-ins with the law , and before long he\\'s being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight . \\nprofessor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) , who had brought up the math problems in his lectures , tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police : will is to be released , provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions . \\nthis sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff , but \" good will hunting \" rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and clever drama . \\na conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and will\\'s therapist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) - lambeau wants to get will to use his brain , while sean wants him to listen to his heart , both of which he has been largely neglecting . \\nwill finds that the former is much easier than the latter , so much so , in fact , that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly resistant to lambeau\\'s attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle . \\nhe also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar ( minnie driver ) , an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluctant will to come with her . \\nwhat makes \" good will hunting \" work so well , aside from the strong performances ( especially from damon and williams ) , is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in will\\'s life . \\nthe script\\'s sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau , but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong . \\nlambeau , while he may seem a little cold at times , is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when we\\'re not sure if we like what he has to say . \\nand sean , for all his warm-heartedness , has , as lambeau and later will point out , not lived up to his full intellectual potential either ; the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will . \\nwill\\'s reaction to this situation , and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean , is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters\\' opinions , rather than setting up an obvious \" right \" and \" wrong \" side and beating them over the head with it . \\nfor a film with such an extraordinary character , \" good will hunting \" presents itself as remarkably ordinary ; it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman , a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another . \\nthis film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama , by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally far-fetched situation . \\n \" good will hunting \" also has its share of fun humor , such as when will , in an early therapy session , pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture . \\nand in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear , will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa . \\nwill\\'s relationship with his friends , most notably chucky ( ben affleck ) , is usually rather amusing , if somewhat crude ( the film has 100+ uses of the \\'f\\' word , which was most likely the reason for its r-rating ) , and lends itself well to the development of will\\'s character . \\nadd all this to the fact that \" good will hunting \" even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental , and you might be wondering why i haven\\'t given this film four stars . \\nwell , for one thing , no matter how well damon and affleck , who wrote the screenplay , and director gus van sant pull it off , the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original . \\nthere are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic , including one that was supposed to be emotional but really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions . \\nstill , \" good will hunting \" takes its premise a lot farther than i thought it would , and is definitely one of the better personal dramas i have seen in the last few years , and as of right now it stands as one of the top five on my list of \\'97 films . \\n',\n",
              " 'the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now : \" it mu5t be found . \" \\nso what , exactly , is the fifth element ? \\nafter seeing luc besson\\'s ambitious , much-shrouded-in-secrecy science fiction fantasy , i could not help but be let down by the actual answer , which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think . \\nbut what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole , a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do--create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen . \\nthe biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wraps--the actual storyline--is the most conventional , dismayingly so , element ( pun intended ) of the film . \\nspeaking in the vaguest possible terms , the basics of the plot are as follows : in the year 2259 , a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth , and only the four elements--earth , wind , fire , and water--united with a fifth element can stop it . \\nfiguring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas ( bruce willis ) ; a shady , southern-drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg ( the hilariously hammy gary oldman , picking up where he left off in besson\\'s the professional ) ; a priest ( ian holm ) ; and a mysterious creature named leeloo ( milla jovovich ) . \\nall of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelming--and unsurprising--fashion , but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest . \\nwhat remains interesting and exciting , however , after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil , director of photography thierry arbogast , visual effects supervisor mark stetson , and the crew at digital domain . \\nthe look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last . \\nthe frenzied cityscape of new york , with its vibrant day-glo colors , tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds , and the swarm of cars , cabs , and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways , is absolutely breathtaking to behold , especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film . \\nbut it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren\\'t equally as interesting , and are they ever . \\nin addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world , from bulky robots to dog-like mangalores , the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean-paul gaulthier , best known for creating madonna\\'s pointy bustier get-up in her blonde ambition tour . \\ngaulthier\\'s outlandish creations , such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps , feel more at home in besson\\'s futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world ; they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film . \\nwhile besson\\'s bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film , it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience . \\nfor all its imagination , certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and bizarre . \\ni really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film , ruby rhod ( chris tucker ) , a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative--he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress , sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer , speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed . \\nat first this character\\'s hyper energy is funny , but the act wears out its welcome very quickly . \\nnot irritating , but just as strange , is a musical number by blue-skinned alien chanteuse diva ( maiwenn lebesco ) , who sings--and dances--an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno . \\nthe tune , as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra\\'s innovative score , is haunting , but it is also completely jarring . \\nthen there are the campy touches of humor besson and co-scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout , which too often are silly and forced ; a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and a flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny , to boot . \\nthe story\\'s weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element . \\nwhile still visually and aurally spectacular , the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be . \\nthe big , serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers , and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward . \\nas such , at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here , that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters . \\nthis suspicion was confirmed by besson himself , who told me in the lobby following the screening ( imagine that , the filmmaker watching the film with the \" enemy \" --the critics ) that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half--now titled mr . shadow--is still waiting to be made . \\nstill , despite the story problems , the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson ;

) with the power of an electrical storm . \\nalmost no time was granted on his charecter , who is the most important and vital charecter in the novel . \\nhere , branagh introduces the character of victor frankenstein , establishes his obsession with the very nature of life and death , sets up the intellectual and ideological conflict between victor and the academic establishment , and somehow manages to build up to a rousing and horrifying creation scene . \\nbranagh plays frankenstein with a remarkable understanding of his character . \\non the outside he is strong , ambitious and talented scientist , but deep down he is unsecure , fragile and vaulerble , constantly haunted by the ghosts from his past . \\nhelen boham carter is equally wonderful as frankenstein\\'s surrogate sister , who at the end becomes his wife for a little while , before death drives them apart . \\nthe rest of the cast , playing secondary characters , is solid and nothing less than convincing . \\nvisually the film is stunning ( especially the makeup ) . \\nthe spinning camera , the constantly building-up musical acore , the art direction , the production design , the costumes are all magnificent : from the arctic ocean to the swiss alps and dark forests , to the plague-riddled streets of ingolstadt , mary shelley\\'s frankenstein is a wonder to behold . \\nkenneth branagh directs his film as if the script was written by shakespeare : \" . . all \\ni once loved lies in a shallow grave . . . . by \\nmy hand . . \" . \\nand the film ends exacly as hamlet , when the creature sets both his and his creator\\'s body on fire . \\nthe film ends with frankenstein and his creation burning in the almost hellish fire in the darkness . \\nand a terrifying last close-up on the creature\\'s smiling face . \\ncan a man create life , then abandon his creation because its appearance horrifies him ? \\nto whom are its actions then attributable : the creature or the being who brought about its existence ? \\nshelley did not answer these questions , but she certainly posed them . \\nfollowing her example , branagh does the same . \\nhis film is a tragic saga about playing god . \\nvictor frankenstein is not an evil man . \\nhe wanted to change the world to the better . \\nin this he represents everything science stands for : acting without doubts , never considering the consequences of his actions . \\nproduced by francis ford coppola , frankenstein resembles in some respects coppolas previous film \" dracula \" . \\nin comparison , i can say that \" dracula \" has visuals that even \" frankenstein \" can not live up to . \\nbut when it comes to story , characters and casting , \" frankenstein \" is stronger . \\nbut stronger than both of them , on every aspect , is neil jordan\\'s \" interview with the vampire \" . \\nalthough the film is not perfect ( the camera that simply refuses to stay still and the occasionally pushy score are at times more tiering than effective ) , these minor faults are easily forgivable , as the picture is otherwise captivating and stimulating . \\nbranagh has probably created one of the best ( if not the best ) adaptions of shelly\\'s classic novel . \\n',\n",

              " ' \" say , any of you know how to madison ? \" \\n--- brad \" asshole \" majors ( barry bostwick ) shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode to the time warp in the cult classic the rocky horror picture show . \\nthe story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend . \\nin the early 70\\'s , stage actor turned first-time playwright richard o\\'brien decided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy b-movies he had grown up with as a child , set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design . \\nthe result was the stage play the rocky horror show , which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in 1973 and was even hailed the best musical of 1973 by prominent drama critics in england . \\nthe play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later , in october of 1974 . \\nthe film version ( now titled the rocky horror picture show ) was released in 1975 . . . \\nand immediately tanked at the box office . \\nwhether it was because fox wasn\\'t quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didn\\'t quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined , but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop . \\nit seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters . \\na year later , something entirely strange and magical happened . \\nprints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country , and it was then that a whole new audience found the film . \\nthis new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film , acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played , yelling rude comments at the screen , and just generally having a good time . \\nword quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture show\\'s life as the ultimate cult film was born . \\nfor the virgins out there who are unaware , the plot centers around a loving couple , brad majors ( barry bostwick ) and janet weiss ( susan sarandon ) , who come from a small town called denton . \\nbrad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed . \\nthey plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting , dr . everett scott ( jonathan adams , who played the narrator in the original stage version ) , but their car gets a flat on the way to his home . \\nremembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road , they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance . \\nthe castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual ( in the galaxy of transylvania ) , who are lead by the eccentric fishnet-stocking wearing mad scientist dr . frank-n-furter ( tim curry ) . \\nfrank-n-furter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky ( peter hinwood ) . \\nas rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment , brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of frank-n-furter\\'s mad schemes . \\nlittle do any of them know that the doctor\\'s handyman , riff-raff ( original author richard o\\'brien ) , and domestic , magenta ( patricia quinn ) , are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth . \\ngoing back and revisiting this film after ten years ( 1990 being the first time i had ever seen it ) , it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has . \\nif i had been a fox executive around the time of its release , i don\\'t think i would have known what to make of it either . \\nfor all intents and purposes it is a bad movie ( though bad in a really good sort of way ) , but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film . \\nby the time the credits role , it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters , and one really gets the feeling that richard o\\'brien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy b-movies his film is based on . \\nwhen i say that the wall-to-wall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that , once you hear them , they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity . \\nit goes without saying that the \" time warp \" is the most popular song in the film . \\neven people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song . \\nwhat those who haven\\'t seen the movie don\\'t know though , is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment . \\nmy personal favorite is \" over at the frankenstein place \" , but \" dammit janet \" is also maddeningly catchy . \\ntim curry\\'s vocals on the rocking tune \" sweet transvestite \" need to be heard to be believed . \\nthe finale of the film , a big floor show staged by frank-n-furter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets ( including barry bostwick . . . \\nfrightening ! ) , features no less than four songs ( \" rose tint my world \" , \" don\\'t dream it \" , \" wild and untamed thing \" , and \" i\\'m going home \" ) , all of which are immensely singable . \\nthe film\\'s true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though . \\ndespite the catchiness of the songs , this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadn\\'t have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show . \\nwatching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans ( unless you don\\'t mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place ) . \\nnote : director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film , in the form of a sequel , resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment , which picks up with brad and janet ( this time played by cliff de young and jessica harper ! ) as contestants on a game show in their home town of denton . \\nthe two are menaced by the evil tv station manager ( also played by de young ) , who wishes to claim janet as his own . \\no\\'brien returned as a writer/performer on the project ( as did quinn , campbell , and gray in performance capacity only ) , but the film had nowhere near the spirit of the original . \\n25 years later , this film is still the pinnacle of cult filmdom and is continuously screened at midnight all over the world . \\nas a lasting testament to the longevity of the film and its legion of fans , a brand new special edition 2-disc dvd set has been released that is the most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror to date ( even out shining the laserdisc special edition that was released for its 20th anniversary ) . \\nif you are one of those people who can\\'t get enough of the film , this disc should be more than enough to satisfy your appetites . \\nin an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film , fox home entertainment has released this wonderful 2-disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that it\\'ll take a good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all . \\nthe film itself is located on the first disc and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) . \\nthe film is presented in two different versions , the us theatrical version and the uk version which adds a musical number during the finale called \" superheroes \" . \\nfor ambitious viewers , the disc also includes a hidden version ( located on the main menu by clicking left from the scene selection menu choice and highlighting a pair of lips in the lower left corner ) which presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed to have been seen . \\noriginally , the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz , with the first half of the it seen in black and white ( and not changing to color until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad and janet during the time warp musical number ) . \\nmost reports , including a documentary on the disc , say that the color was supposed to appear when frank-n-furter first shows up in the elevator , but it does seem to work better where it was placed on this version , depicting the vast difference between the world brad and janet were used to compared with the one to which they are introduced . \\nthe film contains a commentary track by show creator ( and faithful handyman ) richard o\\'brien and co-star patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable ( and quinn immediately starts off by refusing to speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet and half-naked on freezing cold sets , which she apparently complained about the entire film and in future interviews ) . \\nthe two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell , but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer with us anymore ( and there are quite a few ) . \\nfox has also tried to recreate the feel of attending the film in a theater with several audience participation segments . \\nthe first feature ( and the most simple ) is a subtitle prompter which lets you know when to open up on people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is . \\nthe second feature is an audience participation track , which lets you in on what you might hear on a good night out at the show . \\nmost of the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off , but every once and a while a comment can be heard that will invoke a bit of laughter . \\nthe final participation segment uses a technology very much like the technology used on the matrix dvd , where a pair of lips will appear on-screen during certain scenes of the film ( mostly during the musical numbers ) that can be selected by pressing enter on your remote . \\nwhen selected , you will be taken out of the film and into a live participation version of the scene put on during one of the many screenings that occur all over the world . \\nonce the segment is over , you are deposited right back into the film where you left off . \\nthe first disc also contains a few dvd-rom goodies for those with that particular type of dvd player . \\nthere is a timeline of the evolution from the stage play version to worldwide cult sensation , a video jukebox , a you don\\'t know jack-styled trivia game ( which is about as bare bones a you don\\'t know jack parody as it can be ) , and a bizarre mad-libs styled word game known as riff-raff\\'s story lab . \\nlinks to the rocky horror websites are also available from the dvd-rom portion of the disc . \\nthe second disc features even more goodies for the person who loves extras . \\nformer lite-rock video channel turned music historians vh-1 have allowed some of their outtake footage from the \" behind the music : rocky horror \" special that they ran earlier in the year to be shown here , as well as a pop-up video for the meat loaf-sung \" hot patootie \" . \\nthe \" behind the music \" segments are all very interesting , especially richard o\\'brien\\'s jaunt through the castle ( which is now a hotel ! ) where the film was originally shot . \\nthere are also extensions of the sarandon , bostwick , quinn , o\\'brien , and meat loaf interviews . \\nas far as extras for the film itself go , there are two deleted musical numbers that are also included here . \\none of which is just the \" superheroes \" number available in the uk version , but there is also another rare musical number presented here called \" once in a while \" . \\na series of alternate takes are also presented here , but none of them are really much of a revelation ( except for the undressing scene in which we see that patricia quinn is having a hard time unbuttoning barry bostwick\\'s pants ) . \\nfor the completist who must have every little bit of rocky horror paraphernalia , a misprinted end sequence and alternate credit sequence are also presented here . \\nrounding out the disc is a decent documentary called rocky horror double feature video show , two theatrical trailers ( proclaiming that the film is \" a different sort of jaws \" ) , a still gallery , and two sing-a-longs ( for \" toucha toucha touch me \" and \" sweet transvestite \" ) . \\nfox\\'s special edition is the dvd set that rocky horror fans have been waiting for all their lives ( \" you\\'re lucky . . . \\ni\\'m lucky . . . \\nhe\\'s lucky . . . \\nwe\\'re all lucky ! \" ) . \\nit\\'s not just amazing enough that tons of classic italian films are finally getting their recognition in the u . s . , but even long standing traditions are finally receiving their due on the wonderful dvd format . \\nas with their excellent dvds of the abyss , fight club , independence day , and the sound of music , fox shows that they have most certainly made the commitment to provide the things that dvd lovers want . \\ni raise a toast to them ( cue the throwing of the bread ) as i cut out the lights , sit back , and watch those disembodied lips begin to sing about b-movie tradition . \\n[r] \\n',\n",

              " 'there\\'s no reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based , as its opening credits proclaim , on a true story . \\nbut if it\\'s an accurate picture of life on america\\'s mean streets , than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had a much stronger basis in reality than i would have previously thought . \\nfor from the film\\'s outset , when a group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles ( not unlike a number of movie lowlifes who recently gave a madonna song a close reading ) donnie brasco resembles more than passingly a few gangster flicks once believed to be works of fiction . \\nour eponymous hero ( johnny depp ) is not the cheap crook he first appears to be . \\nbrasco is joseph pistone , an undercover fbi agent who has the task of chumming-up to lefty ( al pacino ) , a seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art of being a \" wiseguy \" . \\nregrettably , pistone learns his lessons all too well . \\nhis concern for lefty , who is burdened with a heroin addicted son , exacerbates his own family troubles : his children resent his lengthy absences and his wife fears that her husband\\'s gangster persona is becoming a little too convincing . \\ntrue , the focus on pistone\\'s family life does deviate from the typical gangster-flick formula , but this subplot never rises above its television drama origins . \\nthe unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in drawn-out domestic squabbles ? including an ill-advised marriage guidance routine ? that slow the film down unnecessarily . \\nthe biggest problem with donnie brasco , however , is that its wiseguy attitude and style lacks the flair of its many predecessors . \\nthe awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70\\'s , but not with the consistent and blindingly tacky style ? i loved those fluoro coloured suits ? of scorces\\' costume drama casino . \\nmore importantly , pacino\\'s presence triggers memories of his earlier movie triumphs in which similar territory was covered far more effectively . \\ndonnie brasco\\'s take on american values , for instance , is feeble and obvious . \\nlefty rambles out dreams of material betterment to the accompaniment of grating inspirational music . \\ninexplicably , lefty\\'s horatio alger inspired gush is supposed to move us . \\nit doesn\\'t any more than his family troubles do , which are dealt in the same saccharine and obvious manner as pistone\\'s . \\njust think a minute on how these themes were explored in the godfather movies and scarface . \\nin these pictures pacino\\'s dedication to a peculiar and bloody hyper-capitalism was twisted and confronting , while his dogged application of macho wiseguy procedure meant that his relations to friends and family was intriguingly dark ? neither were spared bloody retribution for breaching wiseguy regulations . \\ndonnie brasco\\'s tawdry little crime , therefore isn\\'t so much its repetition of familiar gangster themes , but the shameless way in which it sanitises them . \\n ( oh and by the way , i forgot to mention that the script also sports a startling subplot : pipstone\\'s superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constant insubordination ? is that a \" damn you mcbain ! \" \\ni hear from springfield way ? ) \\nso the movie is cliched . \\nbig deal , what do you expect from a gangster-flick ? \\nwell you expect quality action sequences and bravado performances in abundance if its going to be a decent example of the genre . \\ndonnie brasco fails on both counts . \\nthe action scenes never rise above the ordinary and depp\\'s woeful performance tends to smother the good-work of his comrades . \\nadmittedly , pacino does nothing new and michael madsen ( sonny ) simply smirks his way through the picture like a slightly subdued mr . white , but both possess an unmistakable sly charm . \\ndepp usually exhibits a bit of class himself , but regrettably , being in the presence of one of his betters must have left him star-struck , for he is completely hell-bent on mimicking pacino\\'s well-earned high style . \\nthe consequences are painful to watch . \\nits no exaggeration to say that the film\\'s credibility is seriously strained by the sight of the pistone family\\'s uncanny ability to keep a straight face in front of their breadwinner\\'s phony brooklyn accent . \\nperhaps we should take pity on the makers of donnie brasco . \\nmaybe a scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accuracy demanded tiered dialogue and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks . \\nif this is indeed the case , surely the makers of donnie brasco could have explored the fascinating possibility that america\\'s underworld is committed to emulating , albeit in heavily attenuated form , their movie namesakes . \\ndepp could have poignantly played a simple cop who becomes a hideous parody once he is forced to mimic big-screen gangster greats . \\nwho knows what insights into the criminal psyche could have arisen ?

              " 'steven spielberg\\'s \" amistad , \" which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship , then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who \" owned \" them , is concerned with several different aspects of this story . \\nfirst , the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery . \\nsecond , it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case , including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) . \\nlast , and most importantly , it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade . \\n \" amistad \" succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements . \\ni have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another \" anti-slavery \" movie . \\nhaving seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery , i doubted that there was much i didn\\'t already know about it . \\nfortunately , i turned out to be wrong . \\nfor one thing , spielberg\\'s camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders\\' operations in africa , so \" amistad \" was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning . \\nand some of the images here are , in fact , much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery . \\none scene in the middle , in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their \" excess \" slaves by throwing them overboard to drown , has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year . \\nspielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would , and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc-17 rating . \\nthe stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians , such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain , whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time . \\nexposing politicians as narrow-minded , opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff , of course , but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation . \\nthe film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time , such that john quincy adams ( and probably other politicians like him ) , who clearly disapproved of the practice , was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court . \\nthe biggest success of \" amistad \" is probably the characterization of cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , the lawyer who represents them in court . \\nthrough cinque , we are given a window into the native culture , as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member , or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ . \\ncinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that , again , contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles . \\n \" what kind of country is this , where laws \\'almost\\' work ? \" he asks baldwin in bewilderment , when he learns that the case must be re-tried before the supreme court . \\nspielberg\\'s direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times , such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque\\'s angry outburst in the court room . \\nstill , there isn\\'t enough of this for it to be a serious problem . \\nthe main flaw in this film , which prevents it from earning four stars , is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni can\\'t quite handle all of these issues at the same time , so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie . \\nthis summer\\'s contact , for example , dealt with several issues at once , but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and , most importantly , all of them were resolved at once . \\n \" amistad \" tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams , but it somehow feels a little forced , and in any case the speech itself , which lasts almost fifteen minutes , wears out its welcome about halfway through . \\nperhaps the best way to describe it is this : \" amistad \" is three four star films edited into one . \\nalmost every individual scene works , but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence , and thus is less than the sum of its parts . \\nhowever , i can\\'t honestly say how it could have been done differently , and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film , and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery . \\n',\n",

              " 'i like movies with albert brooks , and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks . \\nlost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies . \\nhis humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today , inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator . \\nyou will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film , while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent \" talk films \" which are finding their way into theaters . \\nthe situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with , but even if we can\\'t , brooks has the talent to make them comfortable , and therefore we laugh . \\nteenagers and jim carrey fans probably won\\'t find an albert brooks movie very funny , but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will . \\nput simply , brooks\\' comedy is intelligent . \\nmother is albert brooks\\' latest film , and it does not disappoint . \\nbrooks plays john henderson , a middle-aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce . \\nhe makes an attempt at dating , but fails miserably . \\nhe then has dinner with his brother jeff ( rob morrow ) , a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life . \\njeff has a good job , a loving family , and most of all , a warm relationship with their mother beatrice ( debbie reynolds ) . \\nafter dinner , john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice , and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky-dory the dialog is . \\nin comparison , beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him , and john gives it right back to her . \\nat the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john\\'s life , she says , \" i love you , \" and john replies with , \" i know you think you do . \" \\nthe thing is , beatrice is not overt with her criticisms , but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit-picking and guilt loading . \\nit\\'s the kind that goes something like , \" yes , dear , i think you do that wonderfully , but . . . . \" \\nit seems as though nothing he does makes her happy . \\nthere\\'s always the big but . \\njohn believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women , either because of his flawed self-esteem caused by his need for validation , or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner . \\nhe comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home , he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out , and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is . \\n \" a great experiment \" , he calls it . \\nbrooks\\' own brand of humor really shines in this film , especially in the interaction john has with his mother . \\nthere\\'s a scene where john has just arrived at his mother\\'s house , and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito , and having explained to his mother about the \" great experiment \" , beatrice asks , \" now explain to me again why you don\\'t want to stay at a hotel . \" \\nshe still doesn\\'t get it , and it is absolutely hilarious . \\nin the same scene , we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh . \\nshe apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over . \\nwhen john points out the ice on the sherbet , beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze . \\n \" you\\'ve named the ice ? \" \\nasks john . \\nhe\\'s also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator , such as a twenty-pound block of cheese . \\n \" the freezer was a good invention , \" says john , \" but it\\'s not supposed to be used for everything . \\nthat\\'s why it\\'s smaller than the refrigerator . \" \\nit\\'s something most of us find strangely familiar . \\nbrooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur . \\nfor example , in defending your life , his and meryl streep\\'s characters are in a comedy club having a discussion . \\nwhen they\\'re finished and walk out , brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line , \" and so the moral is , if you have to fart , go outside ! \" \\nyou don\\'t know what the joke was because you couldn\\'t hear him during the entire scene , but i must have laughed for the next five minutes , it seemed so out of context . \\nin this film , brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene . \\ni don\\'t want to give them away , but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past . \\njohn\\'s purpose for staying with his mother is to learn , and we as the audience learn right along with him . \\nhis mother is not the fascinating type to begin with , but as john spends more time with her , we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth . \\nwatching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way . \\non screen , brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character : you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world . \\nin a way , he\\'s very much like yosarian of catch-22 , expect with something of an attitude . \\ncasting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect . \\nshe assumes the part with ease , even moving and speaking a little slowly , and is just so adorable it\\'s hard to get mad at her character . \\nthis only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her . \\nas his first choice , brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice , but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband , who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimer\\'s disease . \\nthat may be just as well , since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely . \\nrob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mother\\'s favorite and , for all his success in his job and family , is slowly exposed as a mama\\'s boy . \\nthe only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes . \\na solid connection is not really made between john\\'s troubles and his reasons for living with his mother . \\nadditionally , the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals , and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting , how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this ? : \\nbeatrice : you must think i\\'m some kind of moron . \\njohn : no , i think your someone who thinks i\\'m a moron . \\nbeatrice : well , it takes one to know one . \\n',\n",

\\nas far as i can tell , it refers to a very small plot detail that isn\\'t developed , just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements . \\ncharacter relationships in this film also make very little sense . \\nfor some reason , every person in this film keeps having sex . \\nwe get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes . \\nbassett and spader\\'s characters start off hating each other . \\nfifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later , they\\'re engaging in some hanky-panky . \\nwhen troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship , of course both female crew members will fall in love with him . \\nevery single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly , which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut . \\nthe most prominent example , however , may be the fact that when the film starts , there are no opening credits ! \\nfurthermore , the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits . \\nmaybe that\\'s why the film\\'s title is mentioned twice during the end credits , right between james spader and robert forster . \\nright after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you\\'re seeing ( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery ) , you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene , with little-to-no introduction to any of the characters or situations . \\nthe rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes ( you know , where they explain things ) and just went from point a to point b . point a : danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby . \\npoint b : tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing . \\ndoesn\\'t make sense . \\nsince i didn\\'t understand anything about these characters\\' motivations , did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one-by-one ( and he does , knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes ) ? \\nnot a whit . \\nit\\'s a shame , because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do . \\nthey don\\'t find it . \\nbassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces . \\nsexual tension ? \\nmore like constipation . \\nmaybe they\\'re just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as \" this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice . \" \\nnot that we ever find out who that is , mind you . \\nthe climax of their relationship ( taking place in a transport pod ) is probably the film\\'s biggest forehead-slapper . \\nas troy , peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected . \\nhe\\' s awfully one-note , but it\\'s not as if he\\'s given any more notes to work with . \\nthe rest of the cast does even less . \\ntunney stands around looking cute , then scared . \\nphillips broods . \\ncruz flirts with the computer . \\nthen they all die and a star blows up or something , but i really wasn\\'t paying much attention by then . \\n \" supernova \" is pretty awful , but i\\'m cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got . \\nthat\\'s it . \\nif you expect it to be good ( for whatever reasons you may have ) , you\\'ll probably hate it more than i will . \\neven the special effects are fairly unimpressive , nothing you haven\\' t seen before , and suffice to say the script isn\\'t going to save the film . \\nhonestly , though , what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym ?

              " ' \" jaws \" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . \\nthe movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds . \\nthen it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams\\' now infamous score . \\ndah-dum . \\nfrom there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . \\nright away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once \" jaws \" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . \\nperhaps what is most outstanding about \" jaws \" is how spielberg builds the movie . \\nhe works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . \\nunlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . \\nuntil then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams\\' music . \\nhe\\'s building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark\\'s arrival is truly terrifying . \\nhe doesn\\'t let us get bored with the imagery . \\nthe first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn\\'t been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years . \\nthe island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn\\'t want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money . \\nbrody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . \\nhooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( \" it\\'s a perfect engine , an eating machine \" ) make it that much more terrifying . \\nwhen vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . \\nthe entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . \\n \" jaws \" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror . \\nit is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it\\'s no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by \" star wars \" ) . \\neven today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock\\'s \" psycho , \" and it never seems to age . \\nalthough grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill . \\nthe technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . \\nscheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time \" jaws \" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman . \\nnevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark . \\nscheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what\\'s right and going against the entire town . \\n \" it\\'s your first summer here , you know , \" mayor vaughn warns him . \\ndreyfuss , who had previously been seen in \" american graffiti \" ( 1973 ) and \" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz \" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . \\nhowever , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie\\'s captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards . \\nbordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism . \\nhe\\'s slightly deranged , and shaw\\'s performance is almost a caricature . \\nhowever , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars . \\nquint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s . \\nindianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese . \\nhis tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen . \\nshaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film . \\nof course , we can\\'t leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind\\'s fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature . \\na shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in \" jaws , \" and they are a threat . \\nevery one of spielberg\\'s subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into . \\nthe shark in \" jaws \" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed \" bruce \" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles . \\nmany have forgotten , but \" jaws \" was a sort of precursor to \" waterworld \" ( 1995 ) , a movie\\'s who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb . \\nbut , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood . \\n',\n",

\\nso , i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on \" hard copy \" with pam smart , the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980\\'s . \\n \" hard copy \" \\'s diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman\\'s fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for . \\nsmart replied that she thought kidman\\'s character came off as a dumb , vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal . \\n ( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband . ) \\nsmart\\'s got a point . \\nit wouldn\\'t be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well-acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version . \\nhowever , given a choice between the mass media \\'happening\\' of the real event and the fictionalized movie , i would definitely opt for the later . \\nreal murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart , while pretty and alluring , is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman . \\nto die for begins in a town called little hope , new hampshire , the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb . \\nthe story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being \\'on tv . \\' \\nof course , one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry , played by matt dillon . \\nbut , with a little imagination , some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement , our heroine manages to overcome the nay-sayers in her life , at least temporarily . \\nkidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne . \\ni have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture . \\nher portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates . \\nkidman knows a star-making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience-deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven , post-feminist uber-temptress from hell . \\nshe is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue , which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way . \\nat one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister-in-law . \\n \" you know , \" she knowingly exclaims , \" gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever , if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head . \" \\nher husband beams at suzanne\\'s profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters . \\nthis is very close to pop culture bashing heaven , folks . \\nthe other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix . \\nhe plays jimmy , a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne\\'s sexual favors . \\nkidman\\'s character , vapid though she is , is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia , winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland . \\nphoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen-x slackerhood ( as envisioned by tabloid tv , of course ) . \\nhis jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain\\'t going anywhere , ever . \\nphoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne , someone who actually noticed him . \\ngus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , my own private idaho ) direction is first-rate . \\nhe keeps the pacing in this not-quite-thriller snapping along . \\nvan sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesn\\'t stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions . \\nvan sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to \\'get it\\' without stopping to explain what is funny about this all-american story . \\nthe screenplay , by buck henry , is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i\\'ve heard since heathers . \\nhenry\\'s story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame , yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters . \\nhenry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini-classic . \\ndanny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric , loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands . \\neither film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick-or-treat parties . \\nall-in-all , a wonderful production , well worth your seven bucks !

\\nbulworth\\'s candor wins him three volunteers from the church , one of whom , nikki ( halle barry ) , he gets a crush on . \\nhe feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something . \\nchicken wings , appropriately enough . \\nbulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives . \\nwhen one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings , bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment . \\nwith so much money and so many talented people working so hard , he wonders , why can\\'t hollywood make a quality product . \\n ( you go , warren ! ) \\nwhen they become indignant and ask why he\\'s talking to them if he has such a low opinion of their product , he callously admits that it\\'s because they are rich jews . \\nthat night he drops the three african-american volunteers at their nightclub , and he decides to go in with them . \\nhe stays up all night drinking , smoking pot , dancing , falling in love with nikki , and learning to scratch turntables and rap . \\nthe next day , he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps to the suit-and-tie fundraisers . \\nfrom then on , at all of his political appearances , he raps his political truth . \\nhis rap is not bad for a middle-aged white guy . \\nhe\\'s not very good , but it is his first try and at least he\\'s not embarrassingly bad . \\nhis lobbyists are not amused , but the rest of his constituency seems to like the new bulworth . \\neventually , the movie\\'s plot ( remember he hired a hit man ? ) \\novertakes the politics , which is too bad . \\nscreen time is spent with bulworth trying to cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be closing in on him . \\nthere are even a few gratuitous chase scenes , bulworth fleeing his killer . \\nthese scenes may have been necessary to keep the events of the film moving along , but it distracted and detracted from bulworth\\'s political ranting , which was much more interesting than the ever-present , obvious-looking assassin . \\nstill , most of the movie is original and very enjoyable , and beatty deserves most of credit for bringing it to the screen . \\nas the story and screen writer , he came up first with a good structure , then with good dialogue to back it up ( jeremy pikser co-wrote the screenplay ) . \\nas an actor , he was able to convincingly portray bulworth\\'s depression , then liberation and rebirth . \\nas a producer ( there were four others ) he was able to keep the movie free from hollywood\\'s indulgent formulas ( except for those inexcusable chase scenes ) . \\nsomeone else probably could have directed , but since he was there anyway , what the heck . \\nit\\'s too bad that there aren\\'t more movies like this around - movies that tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more attention to real politics . \\nafter all , much of the inspiration for bulworth is straight out of the news . \\njust a little perception and insight and you could write your own bulworth rants . \\njust don\\'t expect to be popular with the insurance companies . \\n',\n",

\\nthis is the last meal your mother ever made ! \" \\ncrying as they do so , the family finishes the meal . \\nthe scene is comical , awkward , moving , and beautiful . \\nby including the vignettes , itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film , but surprisingly , they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline . \\ninstead , they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo\\'s goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble . \\nbecause the film parodies a western , the construction of the plot is fairly predictable , but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the \" good guys \" come together for the final showdown . \\nin this case , the showdown is against the ramen . \\nif they eat tampopo\\'s ramen , soup and all , tampopo knows she has succeeded . \\nit\\'s pretty obvious what the outcome will be , but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life , you can afford to cut it a little slack . \\n',\n",
              " \"perhaps it's time for me to say a little about my reading habits . \\ni really do like to read , and i've enjoyed many books in my lifetime . \\nmy problem is that i'm a slow reader , and not very dedicated -- i'll enjoy portions of a book and then set it down for months at a time ( it's taken me the last six weeks to get through the first one hundred pages of anna karenina , even though i'm loving the book ) . \\nin addition to this , i typically don't read anything created after the 19th century . \\nthe only reason i bother with this bit of information is because i feel bad admitting , time after time , that i haven't read any of the books on which these films are based ( the only exception , i believe , is great expectations ) . \\nhowever , i don't think it should be necessary to read the book beforehand in order to judge the quality of the film . \\nneedless to say , i haven't read the elmore leonard novel out of sight , on which steven soderbergh's new film is based . \\ni can't say how faithful of an adaptation it is , or if it lives up to leonard's vision . \\ni can say that it's a terrific film , with sharp acting , great dialogue , and pumping full of energy and style injected by soderbergh . \\nit's certainly a nice distraction from 1998's lineup of brainless blockbusters , all hopelessly wishing that size mattered . \\nout of sight proves that it doesn't . \\ni had originally written george clooney off as a one-note actor , incapable of depth but occasionally showing a little flair . \\nafter seeing his latest performance in this film , i've changed my mind -- this guy can act , but he also has that forceful presence that most certainly will make him one of those $20 million superstars . \\nhere , he plays jack foley , a middle aged guy who robs banks for a living . \\nhe does it because it's fun , i think , but the film opens with him getting caught because his car won't start . \\nhe goes to jail -- which is interesting -- only to break out five cinematic minutes later with the help of his friend , buddy ( ving rhames ) . \\nwe're then introduced to karen sisco ( jennifer lopez ) , a u . s . marshall who , conveniently , is waiting with a shotgun as jack escapes . \\nfortunately , they take her hostage , and she and jack spend some quality time in the trunk together as buddy drives them to safety . \\nthe central conflict arises when both jack and karen become obsessed with one another , though their respective jobs make them superficially incompatible . \\nwe soon learn that the film is not told in sequence ( and , since this is a gritty crime comedy , flashbacks of pulp fiction should arise ) . \\nat first , i kind of felt that it was a gimmick , but i guess it was a gimmick in pulp fiction , too . \\nit's a fun gimmick , though , and soderbergh treats the material with enough humor that everything comes off naturally . \\ni've only seen a few of soderbergh's films ( i was impressed both with kafka and sex , lies , and videotape ) , but i think he's excellent at what he does . \\nhe's an artist without making it obvious , and without being pretentious , which is always admirable . \\nhe uses tricks , yes ( lots of freeze-frame stuff here ) , but it all adds to the smooth and quirky currents in the film . \\nas i said , clooney is terrific , and he's matched by lopez . \\nlopez is , of course , beautiful , but she can act , too . \\ni can sense that she's honing in on her skills , for she comes off more natural here than she has in any of her previous ventures ( not that stone gave her much help in the loathsome u-turn ) . \\nthe two actors have arresting chemistry with one another -- the best scene in the film , by far , is the seduction scene . \\nthe brilliance of this scene is also due , in part , to soderbergh , for he cuts back and forth from their quiet discussion in a bar to the physical act which takes place a few minutes later . \\nthe scene is a series of soft nuances and glances , layered upon light dialogue , and the result is one of the better love scenes in recent cinema -- meaningful and engrossing . \\nthe supporting cast is strong , led by the always-reliable ving rhames . \\ndennis farina , who plays karen's father , is good , as is don cheadle as the profoundly stupid villain . \\nsteve zahn , who plays jack's nearly-brain dead accomplice glenn , steals all of his scenes ( and that's in a film where every scene is already at a high level ) . \\nall of the actors are helped by the dialogue and the intelligently-constructed script by scott frank . \\nout of sight is certainly a light film , although there are a few heavy moments that will linger in the memory . \\noverall , i can recommend it simply as great entertainment . \\nnot every film has to change your life , and it's nice to see a movie that uses the art to tell a great story and simply to entertain its viewers . \\nas for the book , this film is good enough to make me believe that there might be something in the text worth looking at . \\n\",\n",

\\ncasting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with . \\nschwarzenegger is a persona , not an actor , so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea . \\narnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions . \\nin other words , trying to give him dimension was a mistake . \\nharrison ford , mel gibson , or even bruce willis could have played this role ( they\\'ve all played noble and flawed heroes ) , but not schwarzenegger . \\nthere are several scenes that attempt to establish jericho\\'s character ; one has him contemplating suicide , another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter , and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine\\'s location by offering him his old life back . \\nnone of these scenes really work , because arnie isn\\'t up to the task . \\nthe filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong , confident character ( like the terminator , for example ) , the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before . \\nthis one isn\\'t at all believable the way arnold plays him . \\nthe supporting cast tries their hardest , and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all . \\nas the prince of darkness , he\\'s suave and confident . \\nhe acts like one would expect the devil to act . \\nthe problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense ( more on that later ) and that undermines him as a powerful villain . \\nbyrne out-performs arnold in every scene they have together ( including the aforementioned temptation bit ) , but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable : root for the devil . \\nbyrne\\'s speech about the bible being \" overrated \" actually starts to make sense , mainly because arnold\\'s attempts at refuting it ( mostly of the \" \\'tis not ! \" \\nvariety ) are feeble at best . \\nthe only problem is , arnold has to win , so in the end , nobody really cares . \\nkevin pollack plays jericho\\'s security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides , but like most bad action movie sidekicks , he disappears after about an hour . \\nrobin tunney isn\\'t given much to do except look scared . \\nin fact , all of the supporting players are good actors , but none , save for byrne , is given anything interesting to do . \\nperformances aside , it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it . \\nthis being an action blockbuster , it\\'s no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script , which starts off totally confusing , and when some of it is explained ( and not much of it is ) , it\\'s utterly ridiculous . \\nwhy is the devil coming on new year\\'s eve , 1999 ? \\nbecause it\\'s exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil , which isn\\'t 666 , it turns out . \\nsome nutty priest accidentally read it upside down , so the real year is 999 , so just add a 1 to the beginning , and you\\'ve got 1999 ! \\nif you don\\'t buy this explanation , you\\'re not alone . \\nit\\'s convoluted and silly at the same time . \\nthe method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous ( she\\'s christine , see , and she lives in new york , see . \\n . \\n . ) , and if that weren\\'t bad enough , there\\'s plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn\\'t explained at all . \\nwhy can satan kill everyone he passes on the street , but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex-cop , he\\'s powerless ? \\nis he impervious to only one kind of bullet ? \\nhow come he can\\'t control jericho or christine ? \\nand how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies ? \\na clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this , but it\\'s never actually explained . \\nusually , this sort of thing wouldn\\'t matter in a schwarzenegger flick ( i mean , don\\'t get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies ) , but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting . \\nthere are several predictable horror film clich ? s present in \" end of days , \" complete with the old \" black cat hiding in a cabinet \" bit , not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there . \\nit gets so formulaic that it\\'s possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a \" boo \" will come . \\ntheir predictions will rarely be wrong . \\nthe more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless , partially because we don\\'t care about these characters ( due to the script\\'s pathetic attempts at characterization and setup ) , and also because they , too , don\\'t make any sense . \\nthere\\'s a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady . \\nit\\'s good for a few chuckles , but not much else . \\nsupposedly we\\'re to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan , but the script never sets that up , so the scene is merely silly . \\nnone of this is terribly exciting , because all the action sequences are so badly framed that it\\'s often hard to tell why it\\'s happening in the first place , not to mention that they\\'re edited in full-on incomprehensible mtv quick-cut style . \\nmost of them had me scratching my head , rather than saying , \" wow , cool ! \" \\n \" end of days \" is not only silly and confusing , but it\\'s also distinctly unpleasant to watch . \\nthe devil apparently doesn\\'t operate in the more subtle , i\\'ll-convince-people-to-kill-each-other fashion outlined in the bible , but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight . \\nthis doesn\\'t only make him an awfully predictable sort , but it also means that not a single scene in \" end of days \" goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence , or the odd kinky sexual encounter ( yet another bit that had me scratching my head ) . \\nif violence is supposed to be shocking , it\\'s not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb . \\nscenes aren\\'t connected through any reasonable means , so a lot of the time , stuff gets blown up , or people get killed , and i had no idea why . \\nreasons ? \\nto hell with reasons ! \\nlet\\'s just blow stuff up ! \\nisn\\'t it cool ? \\nnope , not by a long shot . \\nthis film is thoroughly unwatchable . \\nit\\'s dull , interminable , and unrelenting in its stupidity . \\nperhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career , because it\\'s not happening with hack peter hyams here . \\n \" end of days \" might have had camp value , if only it didn\\'t top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobody\\'s going to buy . \\nif the movie is going to be serious , the filmmakers should have come up with a decent script . \\nif it\\'s going to be campy , arnold shouldn\\'t be taking himself so damn seriously ( i didn\\'t actually see him put up on a cross , did i ?

\\nmagruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it - and by then it's too late . \\nas the plot unfolds , magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are . \\nand life is never so bad that it can't get worse . \\nif you're familiar with altman's work , you'll recognize several of his signature techniques . \\ncharacters are not introduced in establishing shots , but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent . \\ncrucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows , making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action . \\ndialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style . \\nand of course there's my favorite altman technique - the obligatory nude actress shot . \\nthanks to altman , here are some of the actresses i've had the pleasure of seeing naked : sally kellerman , julianne moore , madeline stowe , even frances mcdormand . \\nand now i can add embeth davidtz , who looks quite healthy in the altogether . \\nthe naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film . \\nis it old-school sexism , or a clever in-joke ? \\nyou be the judge . \\nbut back to the picture at hand . \\nin the hands of a mere mortal , the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller , no better or worse than the countless others we've all endured . \\nin the hands of a master like altman , it becomes an exercise in existential doom , in its own way far more successful than scorsese's cape fear remake , which tried for the same result . \\nwhat may prevent it from enduring with altman's greatest work is a weak third act - in fact , there really is no third act in grisham's story , so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up . \\nbut there are true moments of riveting suspense , and great performances by branagh , davidzt and downey jr - more than enough to see you through . \\nthat polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman , and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back , should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are . \\nthey probably wanted it to look more like a time to kill . \\nand that , my friends , should make you very afraid . \\n\",\n",

              " 'it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship , a green ovular pin , and the birth of oscar wilde , but if one really strains , they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off . \\nwilde\\'s philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature , and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned , loosing his family and his career . \\nthe glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise . \\nthe main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life ( mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality ) , they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else . \\nand that\\'s why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began . \\nit\\'s been said that todd haynes\\' \" velvet goldmine , \" the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement , not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it , steals a lot from \" citizen kane , \" and that\\'s true . \\nin the film , a british journalist in the 80s , arthur stuart ( christian bale ) , is asked to go back and find out what happened to 70s glam rock star brian slade , a fictitious rock star , who faked his own death on stage , bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement . \\nstructure-wise , this totally steals from \" kane , \" not only from the set-up ( he interviews three people , and the story is a result of their flashbacks ) , but in other things , like the beginning ( death , then newsreel ) , and smaller details , like the bitter ex-friend in a wheelchair and the bitter ex-wife as a washed-up lounge singer , found in a bar after hours . \\nthis is no \" kane , \" and it really doesn\\'t aspire to be : it doesn\\'t attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like \" kane \" did , and it doesn\\'t really uncover anything poignant about humanity . \\ninstead , it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants . \\nthe 80s scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy , equipped with a performance by bale that is perhaps appropriately dull and unengaging . \\nbut the 70s scenes are engaging , though , not to mention addictively campy . \\nthey radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era , and a feel that\\'s so eerily lighthearted that when combined with the then-footage , they become not only a symbol of decadence , but of times when everything seemed so simple . \\ninstead of creating the world the way it was , haynes paints their own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale : the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom and liberation that after you\\'ve experienced it , everything else seems so mundane . \\nthere\\'s no outside world to speak of , secluding these people inside a protective globe that will eventually crack . \\nhaynes focuses his story on the tale of blade and the other fictitious rock hero , curt wild , and their relationship that created , molded , and then brought down the movement , reducing everyone else who contributed to it as merely that - contributors . \\nblade - played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers - and wild - played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor - are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop , respectively , complete with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been one-time partners in music , but also partners in bed . \\nthrough discussions with slade\\'s ex-manager cecil ( michael feast ) , ex-wife mandy ( toni collette , reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when with slade ) , and finally ex-partner wild , journalist stuart begins to remember his own experiences in the era , like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity , including the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality ( when he opens up his first slade record , he finds a naked and green slade lying on a crimson blanket ) , and finally running away from home to be part of the london scene , finally resulting in leading a boring job in america . \\nhaynes demonstrates that he\\'s quite the visual auteur , molding scenes that are like long heald breaths , such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a slade/wild concert of them performing a brian eno cover , \" baby\\'s on fire , \" with scenes from a decadent drug party ; and the film\\'s most wow-inspiring sequence , the first concert scene of wild with his band , the ratttz , where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggy-esuqe movements ( including stripping naked ) and screams that the film captures that perfect moment when one discovers a major talent , and another ( slade ) discovers his idle . \\neven the brief music videos , spoofs of bowie\\'s , have a rare visual flair that\\'s pure camp , and which would cause ken russell to drool . \\nthe best sequence , though , may be the beginning , following the prelude , a sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of the movement and the post-movement era . \\nin it , stuart and his mates are going to the infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death , where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears to be a real assasination , which brought about the end of the era in one swift fake bullet . \\nwith brian eno\\'s famous \" needle in the camel\\'s eye \" playing in the background , the scene has a detached exhileration - the song doesn\\'t seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are . \\nit has a distance that\\'s hard to put a finger on , and it seems to represent that all this is coming to a quick and sad ending , and when one sees slade in the dressing room before the show , docked in a silver frock with wings and blue hair , depressingly staring into the mirror , it comes off as a none-too-obvious prophecy of the finale in the beginning of the film . \\nthis movie\\'s not so much about plot , but more about the way it is presented , making this one of those films which is classified as being \" style over substance , \" a statement which prompts many critics to line up for attack . \\nhowever , for the most part , the engaging part of this film is not the story but rather the way in which haynes creates this world , by using his sets , costumes , cinematography , and especially the music to play as characters in his film . \\nthe music is especially notable . \\nthe soundtrack , which is wall to wall , consists of old school glam rock tunes by the likes of brian eno , t-rex , and roxy music , as well as covers by slade\\'s band ( with vocals by thom yorke , and occasionally rhys meyers himself ) , and even newer music by shudder to think that sounds uncannily bowie-like . \\nthe cast is rather impressive , but no one really walks away with the film , and no performances are extremely good . \\nalthough eddie izzard , as slade\\'s manager ( who challenges slade\\'s first manager to an arm-wrestling match to see who gets control of his career ) and michael feast as the first and tragic manager come off greatly , and collette and mcgregor have their moments , rhys meyers and bale are noticably sub-par , neither putting a lot of effort into their respective roles . \\nsome of it is at fault with the actual construction of the film by haynes . \\nrhys meyers\\' brian slade remains merely a metaphor for the glam rock era , dying when he turned into a retro-garbo , resorting to a life of salinger-ism , and found in the mid-70s to be lying around , sniffing coke off the ass of a party girl . \\nin fact , no one in this film is really seen as a person , rather than just as a symbol or composite of a type who thrived during the era . \\nbale\\'s character is an especially tough sell : bitter and depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood , he\\'s not an extremely personal character , and his cliched experiences ( being hounded by the record store guys for buying a record put out by a \" poof \" ) never help us communicate with him . \\nnevertheless , rhys meyers and mcgregor have the excuses that their characters are not really characters but rather the results of an era that has left them , and others , bitter , part of which helps the film work , since this is a major piece of eye candy . \\nat the prime of the movie , they at least look the role of fashionable leaders -

              " 'according to hollywood movies made in last few decades , life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being . \\neven worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark , god-forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience . \\non the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view . \\nthis film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life . \\nthe film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense . \\ninstead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs , as well as series of local , often very colourful characters . \\nalthough many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator , movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist , 14-year old boy titta ( played by bruno zanin ) and chronicles his sexual frustrations , obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca ( played by magali noel ) , problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family , as well as troubles his father ( played by armando brancia ) have with mussolini\\'s fascist regime . \\namarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film , and it probably explains why it is very popular , even among those people who actually don\\'t like federico fellini\\'s work very much . \\nevery member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film , because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible . \\ndistortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film - word \" amarcord \" is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase \" i remember \" in local italian dialect . \\nin the same way the word is distorted , so is the past in memories of those who remember it . \\nafter the premiere , fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film , but it doesn\\'t matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini\\'s childhood or not ; any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film . \\nfellini\\'s views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film . \\neven the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images . \\ncharacters look like caricatures , actors playing them often deliberately overact , and women , especially those who fuel titta\\'s sexual fantasies , often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions . \\nevery now and then , scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie\\'s characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters\\' visions . \\nbecause of that , almost everything in this film looks different , and in most cases better , than it would have looked in the real life . \\neven the fascism gets fellinian make-over - fellini views mussolini\\'s totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy . \\nwhen fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents , even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour . \\nunlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s , who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda , fellini doesn\\'t care that much about politics . \\nlack of self-righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini\\'s humanistic approach to his characters . \\neach of them , regardless of age , gender , social class or physical appearance , is given opportunity to express his or her views , dreams and fears . \\nfellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection , even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people . \\nbecause of this warmth and democratic spirit , amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century , and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable , melancholic and even tragic moments . \\nfellini couldn\\'t produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie . \\nvignettes aren\\'t memorable because of the characters only ; fellini uses camera , painting film in bright colours , especially in the scenes that depict character\\'s fantasies . \\nfellini also knows how to use locations , whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel , bright-coloured beach or rural countryside . \\neven the down-to-earth streets of rimini , where everyone knows everyone , gets magical dimension during the snowfall . \\non the other hand , lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene . \\nthis atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellini\\'s long-time associate nino rota . \\nhis amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable , most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced . \\nthat music alone should be the reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art . \\n',\n",

) \\nwhile woo\\'s hollywood movies look like the work of a talented upstart , maximum risk is a surprisingly confident picture . \\nthe very first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets of a european city , but lam\\'s use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on . \\nthe film editing is a particularly savvy complement to lam\\'s shooting style , accentuating rather than amplifying the action . \\nthe performances could have used some fine tuning ( in particular , there\\'s an annoying , overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or jettisoned completely ) , and the movie doesn\\'t always overcome the limitations of its genre . \\nthe story is a little mundane , although there are some effective moments involving van damme\\'s unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew he had . \\nbut it\\'s not often that hollywood cranks out a truly satisfying action picture , and it\\'s doubly surprising that this one should come with a mere whisper of publicity . \\nvan damme fans should treat themselves to what may well be the man\\'s best movie , and international action buffs will no doubt savor this flavorful hong kong/hollywood hybrid . \\n',\n",

\\ninitial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix . \\nwhile it does share some characteristics with both films ( particularly the first forty minutes , which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs ) , the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm . \\nthe buzz around this project is that first-time feature film director tarsem singh ( who won many awards for his video of r . e . m . \\'s \" losing my religion \" ) wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story , and a good portion of this film supports that theory . \\ndespite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments , the cell does feature some remarkable imagery . \\nall of the sequences where we delve into someone\\'s mind are incredibly beautiful ( including the dank mind of stargher , whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h . r . giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video ) , proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe . \\nthe first sequence that takes place in stargher\\'s mind is by far the best , featuring one of the most ingenious traps i\\'ve ever seen in a film ( involving a horse , which no one seeing this film will probably forget ) , a zoo-like display of stargher\\'s victims which are animated like marionettes , and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room . \\nif the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant , but alas , the sequences only become more silly as they go along ( despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film ) . \\nthe cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images , but at least vincent d\\'onofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance ( magnified by ten , thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed ) . \\nin my opinion , d\\'onofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film , but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful ( i . e . - \\nthe newton boys , feeling minnesota , the thirteenth floor , and the velocity of gary ) that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him . \\nthe character of stargher is an excellent role for him though , and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him . \\ndetractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film , as it contains heavy doses of both . \\nbesides the nipple ring removal i mention above , there is also stargher\\'s penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs ( prior to his catatonia and capture ) which will have audiences recoiling . \\na sequence where catherine enters stargher\\'s mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting . \\none moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spit-like device . \\nas a narrative film , the cell is sorely lacking . \\nas a collection of images though , the cell is extremely well done . \\nalthough the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half , singh has done what he supposedly set out to do : make a film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together . \\nunfortunately , a well-written script should have been considered too , because without it the cell just seems like any other music video we could see on mtv ( provided , of course , that mtv allowed for the use of graphic violence and language in music videos ) . \\n',\n",

              " 'contact ( pg ) there\\'s a moment late in robert zemeckis\\'s contact where i was reminded of why i started writing movie reviews in the first place . \\nwe see a scientist , dressed in a silvery space suit , walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact , spherical space pod , unaware of what awaits when the ball literally drops . \\nanticipation , excitement , anxiety , fear--the audience experiences it all the emotional tension right with the character , nervously , breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead . \\nit is this sense of discovery , the anticipation of which and its accompanying exhilaration , that makes this adaptation of the carl sagan novel such magical , captivating entertainment . \\njodie foster stars as dr . ellie arroway , a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals . \\nand i mean life--after losing her entire family when she was young , the only thing occupying ellie\\'s world is this quest to discover life beyond this earth . \\nafter dealing with much skepticism on the part of government officials and wealthy financiers , ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission from the distant star vega , which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport . \\nfrom this synopsis , contact does not sound too different to most films about alien contact , but there is a whole lot more to this intelligent film than the sci-fi hook . \\nthe alien contact angle generates a great amount of suspense and awe , but perhaps more than anything else , contact is a character study of ellie , whose obsession with empirical , scientific evidence has erased all belief in a higher power . \\nthe irony is that , while admitting to having no religious faith , she holds onto her belief in extraterrestrial life with such passion and conviction that it becomes , in a sense , a religion in its own right . \\nit would be easy for scripters james v . hart and michael goldenberg , in trying to paint a positive image of the heroine , to champion her scientific beliefs over religious ones , but they wisely eschew easy answers , giving equal time to both sides , and in so doing depict ellie as not completely sane . \\nin the end , there is no right or wrong , nor is there one side that comes off more positive in the other , even slightly so--there are just two very viable points of view , each with their own merits , each with their own faults . \\nthe complex role of ellie is an actress\\'s dream , and foster , a virtual shoo-in for yet another best actress oscar nomination next year , more than rises to the challenge . \\nshe conveys intelligence , determination , warmth , and , in a gutsy move , always on edge . \\nwe root for ellie and feel for her , but we also feel at times that she goes too far . \\ncontact is clearly foster\\'s vehicle , but others are given their chance to shine in smaller roles . \\nmatthew mcconaughey , who receives outrageously high billing for his smallish role , holds his own as the religious counterpoint to ellie , spiritual scholar and government adviser palmer joss ( however , his main storyline , the tentative palmer-ellie romance , is the film\\'s weakest subplot ) . \\njohn hurt is effectively creepy as s . r . \\nhadden , the wealthy eccentric who provides ellie with her research funding . \\nangela bassett continues to impress in her bit role as white house aide rachel constantine . \\nmost memorable of all , though , are tom skerritt and james woods , who play rival scientist dr . david drumlin and national security adviser michael litz , respectively ; both , especially skerritt , embody these asshole characters that the audience hissed just about every single one of their appearances . \\nzemeckis comes off of his three-year break in top shape . \\nalways known as a director of effects-laden extravaganzas , it comes as no surprise that contact\\'s visual effects are quite stunning . \\nthe central space journey is more than a little reminiscent of the close of 2001 : a space odyssey , but with more advanced technology at his disposal , zemeckis\\'s voyage is even trippier than stanley kubrick\\'s yet more wondrously pure . \\nand zemeckis doesn\\'t resist the urge to use the always-interesting incorporate-actors-into-existing-film-footage effect , which is every bit as seamless here as it was in forrest gump . \\neffects , however , are confined to only a few scenes and clearly take a back seat to the drama , emotion , and pure wonder , which zemeckis proved to be quite adept at in gump . \\nit says a lot that , in a summer science fiction film such as this , it\\'s not so much the effects that stay with you as it is the drama and the issues that are raised . \\nthe thought-provoking , two-hour-plus contact is a much-welcome change of pace from summer no-brainers , but the fact that it is a smart film does not mean that it also isn\\'t entertaining . \\nfor all the interesting questions it asks , the film is still what it\\'s being sold as-- \" a journey to the heart of the universe . \" \\nand what a fascinating , unforgettable journey it is . \\n',\n",

they have become trite adventures involving leering witches , friendly dwarves , and cuddly talking animals . \\nbut in their original forms , fairy tales have a dark , wicked edge . \\ncrows tear out the eyes of cinderella\\'s sisters , a gorier fate then they receive in the animated version . \\nhansel and gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven . \\nwriters have become fascinated by the bloodier , morally ambivalent aspects of fairy tales , and are now modernizing the old stories while simultaneously going back to their roots . \\nbefore this trend was in vogue , angela carter--whose stories always have a dark , wicked , subversive edge--had been reinventing fairy tales for years . \\nin the company of wolves , she and neil jordan retell the story of red riding hood , enlivening it with werewolves , rolls royces , and a visit from satan . \\nthe story is structured as a dream , occurring in the mind of rosaleen ( sarah patterson ) , an adolescent girl about whose \\'real\\' life we learn very little . \\nwithin the dream , there are a number of inset stories , most told by dream-rosaleen\\'s grandmother ( angela lansbury ) , and these tales gloss the central story in intriguing , suggestive ways . \\nthe result is a surprisingly successful example of a sinister , contemporary fairy tale . \\ni say \" surprisingly \" because there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong . \\nand there are ways in which it does . \\nthe performances are mediocre , except for lansbury\\'s--she finds the right note for the prim , apple-cheeked granny , the wise and stern teller of cautionary tales . \\nthe soundtrack , synth-heavy , reminded me of bad 80s horror movies , as did the special effects in the shapechanging scenes . \\nprobably state-of-the-art at the time , they are now laughable . \\nbut jordan succeeds at what i consider the trickiest aspect of the film : he transcends the poor acting/music/effects and conveys a sense of the fantastic , of otherness . \\none of the problems in adapting full-blown fantasies is that fantasy is often best left to the imagination of the reader , rather than being subjected to the \\'realism\\' of the screen . \\npart of me would love to see an adaptation of \\'the lord of the rings , \\' but , on the other hand , i know that any filmmaker\\'s recreation of ents , hobbits , and balrogs is inevitably going to be really lame compared to what i picture in my mind . \\nthis makes jordan\\'s accomplishment here seem mighty impressive to me : he imbues the company of wolves with a genuine sense of magic and mystery . \\nthe somewhat ruritanian dreamworld becomes a kind of ur-reality . \\nthe sunshine is exceptionally warm and abundant . \\nthe nights are quiet and misty and eerie and ghostly . \\nthe peasant village is rustic and cozy , the woods old and hoary . \\nthis archetypal realm is the setting for a smart , subtle , literate script , a script which is as good as you\\'d expect from jordan ( himself an accomplished fiction writer ) and carter . \\nfor carter , the cauldron of story is a witches\\' brew , bubbling over with primal ingredients : mist-shrouded forests , ancient graveyards , virginal girls and wise women , wolves with glowing eyes . \\nshe adeptly blends them all together . \\nthere is a symbolic richness to the film ;

              " 'robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible , god-given gifts , but are able to act like ordinary people . \\nin \" the natural \" ( 1984 ) , he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs , the baseball player who was destined to be \" the best there ever was , \" but still acted like a humble farm boy . \\nin \" butch cassidy and the sundance kid \" ( 1969 ) , he was the most dangerous shot in the west , yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good-looking charmer . \\neven in \" indecent proposal \" ( 1993 ) , where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love , redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency , especially when reciting a tale of lost love . \\nin his latest film , \" the horse whisperer , \" based on the best-selling novel by nicholas evans , redford again plays such a character . \\nredford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie - i suppose the character of tom booker , a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses , was just too good to pass up . \\ndespite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses ( a magazine article coins the phrase \" horse whisperer \" to describe his uncanny talent ) , booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life . \\nbooker\\'s talents are taxed into service by annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) , a new york magazine editor whose daughter , grace ( scarlett johansson ) , was recently in a horrible accident . \\nthe accident , which is filmed with gut-wrenching horror , happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses - an eighteen-wheeler kills grace\\'s friend , severely wounds and traumatizes grace\\'s horse , pilgrim , and causes grace to lose part of her right leg . \\nannie believes that if pilgrim can be healed , grace will be healed as well , which leads her to booker . \\nat first , she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse , but that doesn\\'t work . \\ninstead , she packs up grace and pilgrim , leaves her husband , robert ( sam neill ) behind , and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother , frank ( chris cooper ) , and his sister-in-law , diane ( dianne wiest ) . \\nin many ways , the film is like a journey , both literally and symbolically . \\nthe move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal , and it\\'s hard not to see annie and grace\\'s leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs . country . \\nin \" the horse whisperer , \" country is clearly the victor . \\nthe city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness , and it is not until the characters arrive in the wide-open spaces of montana that grace\\'s anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate , annie\\'s controlling nature begins to relax , and pilgrim once again learns to trust people . \\nredford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed \" a river runs through it \" six years ago . \\nin many ways , \" the horse whisperer \" comes from the same poetic vein as \" river , \" and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera-time on the grass and mountains . \\nbut then , that would ruin the magic . \\nmuch of the film\\'s photography is truly elegant , and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land . \\nto further emphasize this , redford and cinematographer robert richardson ( \" natural born killers , \" \" platoon \" ) cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film - which takes place in new york - with mostly cold , harsh bluish filters and a more squarish 1 . 85 : 1 aspect ratio ; when the action shifts to montana , richardson switches to soft-focus and natural lighting , and the screen widens to a 2 . 35 : 1 aspect ratio . \\nin terms of the story itself , \" the horse whisperer \" gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean\\'s \" a brief encounter \" ( 1945 ) and clint eastwood\\'s 1995 adaptation of robert james waller\\'s \" the bridges of madison county \" ( richard lagravenese , co-screenwriter here also adapted \" bridges \" ) . \\nalthough \" the horse whisperer \" has a strong romantic sensibility , i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story . \\nit seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who\\'s being left behind for this brief , heart-sweeping affair , but there rarely is . \\nin \" the horse whisperer , \" the thankless role of being the fuddy-duddy husband falls to sam neill . \\nhe plays the character as a decent , hard-working man who is a good husband and father ; his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him . \\nhe is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away , but simply because he happens to be a normal , fairly uninspiring man . \\nthere is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character . \\nit shows booker and robert going into a horse pen - booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all , while robert looks somewhat frumpy and out-of-place in a baseball cap . \\nas they enter the pen , booker assuredly swings over the fence , while robert hesitates , then opens the gate and , in a goofy moment , forgets to close it behind him . \\nit\\'s a small scene , but it clearly demonstrates the movie\\'s thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness . \\nafter all , booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it . \\nthe best scenes in \" the horse whisperer \" tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie , but rather the healing process of grace and her horse . \\nalthough booker\\'s horse-training methods are mythical and unrealistic , the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing . \\nthese are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace , some of which are humorous , and all of which are tender and true . \\nat some point , i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more . \\nnevertheless , redford is obviously a romantic at heart , and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film . \\nthere are no dramatic sex scenes , but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slow-dancing , always moving ever closer together , that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together . \\nalthough the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character , there are enough moments like that which make \" the horse whisperer \" worth the price of admission . \\n',\n",

red herrings , to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front , to the eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond . \\nit\\'s fairly obvious who the killer is ; in fact , i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions . \\nthe film ultimately shouldn\\'t work , but it does , thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances , the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other . \\nannie wilson ( cate blanchett ) is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown . \\nsome of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale ( hilary swank ) , who is severely abused by her husband donnie ( keanu reeves ) , and buddy cole ( giovanni ribisi ) , an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares he\\'s been having about a mysterious blue diamond that is somehow linked to his father . \\nfor annie , she does not give the readings merely for money , but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyone\\'s future . \\nher late

gets a negative vibe about . \\nat a party with her best friend linda ( kim dickens ) , annie stumbles upon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan ( gary cole ) . \\nsoon after , jessica has disappeared , leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her , and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale , and the pond behind his home . \\n \" the gift \" may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level , but the performances and tight direction from raimi ( who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film , 1999\\'s \" for love of the game \" ) lift the picture up several notches . \\nslowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights , the disappearance of jessica at the 30-minute mark divulges the movie\\'s true intentions and transforms the proceedings into a taut , at times frightening , horror-mystery . \\nat the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett ( 1999\\'s \" the talented mr . ripley \" ) , who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a run-of-the-mill protagonist into a very exact , down-to-earth , realistic person with valid troubles and a caring attitude towards those around her . \\nblanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it , giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had . \\nwe follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing , both as a character and an actress . \\nblanchett isn\\'t the only bright performer , as she is ably supported by one of the best casts of the year . \\nin her first role following her oscar win for 1999\\'s \" boys don\\'t cry , \" hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie , who seeks guidance from annie , but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all : to leave the grossly abusive donnie . \\nas donnie , keanu reeves ( 2000\\'s \" the watcher \" ) makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie , so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all . \\nfor the often-criticized reeves , whose acting abilities have never been the best , this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get , and it is also one of the better performances he has given . \\ngiovanni ribisi ( 2000\\'s \" the boiler room \" ) is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend , and wants her to do nothing but help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad . \\nin the small , but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king , katie holmes ( 2000\\'s \" wonder boys \" ) has turned in yet another stunning supporting turn . \\nher promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before , and she is radiant in her few scenes . \\nfinally , kim dickens ( 2000\\'s \" hollow man \" ) makes her usual strong impression as annie\\'s spicy best friend , linda . \\nthe other notable aspect of \" the gift \" is its moody atmosphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene it\\'s almost suffocating . \\nthanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn and bob murawski ,

\\nof course , tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history - he has appeared in over forty films , which have ranged from the very good ( 1984\\'s \" greystoke : the legend of tarzan , lord of the apes \" ) down to the really bad ( 1981\\'s \" tarzan , the ape man \" with bo derek ) . \\nmost of these films were just cheapie b-movies made in the thirties and forties , starring ex-olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps . \\ntherefore , if another tarzan movie is to be made , one might assume that it would have something new to offer - a different angle , an original storyline , anything to set it apart from all the others . \\n \" greystoke \" added a never-before-seen level of realism to the pulpy tale , and even \" tarzan , the ape man \" at least had the mis-guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek\\'s bare breasts . \\n \" tarzan and the lost city , \" on the other hand , has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue . \\nthe script , by bayard johnson and j . anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come . \\ncomic books have better plots than this . \\nthe movie is so bad , in fact , that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer\\'s comedy \" george of the jungle . \" \\ndidn\\'t the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs ? \\nthe story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established : a quick opening narration tells of tarzan ( casper van dien ) being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes , and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage . \\nwhen the movie starts in 1913 , he is a civilized english gentleman ( without an english accent ) , and he is to marry jane ( jane march ) in less than a week . \\nhowever , when a wicked archeologist/grave-robber named nigel ravens ( steve waddington ) begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar , one of africa\\'s last great secrets , the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle . \\nat first , jane refuses to go , pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding ; but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down , therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her ape-man . \\nonce the film gets going ( in its own sluggish way ) , it delves into a series of jungle adventures , as tarzan , jane , and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city . \\nmost of the so-called adventures are cheesy , predictable , and unexciting , with no pace , tension , or action to speak of . \\nthere are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies , ranging from \" raiders of the lost ark \" ( 1981 ) to \" the goonies \" ( 1985 ) . \\nwhen the movie is running short on action , it includes a few greenpeace-friendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals , releasing a baby elephant from a trap , and throwing ivory tusks into the river . \\nthe movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality . \\nfor instance , when tarzan - who was raised in the jungle - is bit by a cobra , he doesn\\'t even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi-experienced weekend backpacker would do . \\ninstead , he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival . \\nof course , one can\\'t help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is . \\nnot to ruin the ending or anything , but there is no lost city . \\nthere is , however , a lost pyramid , which i suppose is all the resource-strapped fx department could come up with ( the special effects are not worthy of a made-for-tv movie ) . \\nwhich also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid , when it\\'s sitting right out in the middle of an open field ? \\nstrictly speaking , \" tarzan and the lost city \" isn\\'t even bad enough to have camp quality , although casper van dien\\'s laughably stiff performance comes real close . \\nthis movie proves what \" starship troopers \" only hinted at : he cannot act , but he sure looks well-groomed , even in the deepest heart of the african jungle . \\nvan dien is much too much of a pretty-boy to be an effective tarzan ; he\\'s a calvin klein model in a loin cloth . \\ni also wondered what the make-up department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa-1983 steve perry haircut . \\nwaddington makes a decent villain , although he\\'s like a charmless version of belloq from \" raiders of the lost ark . \" as jane , the ex-model jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan . \\nshe does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two , but whenever a snake comes into the picture , she is reduced to a hysterical mess . \\nhowever , amidst all this complaining , i do have one piece of good news . \\n \" tarzan and the lost city \" is so lacking in ideas both new and old , that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid . \\nso , we can say this much for it : at least it had the decency to be short . \\n',\n",

\\nwhat if he\\'s also able to think on his feet ? \\nin fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ? \\nit is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray\\'s the negotiator . \\nin this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force . \\nwhen his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman\\'s home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder . \\nfaced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain\\'s office . \\ni don\\'t quite remember if the captain actually said , \" i hate to do this , but . . . \" , \\nalthough it wouldn\\'t surprise me if he did . \\nluckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above . \\nafter being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t . \\nwalsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed . \\nalthough roman\\'s actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue . \\njackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman . \\nthe actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats . \\nthe script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence . \\nhow can we believe he\\'s going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ? \\nunfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it\\'s would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson\\'s acting ability . \\nalmost every time he\\'s in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back . \\nwhen spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course . \\nhis is an interesting character . \\nmade out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation . \\n \" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can\\'t talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , \" he says . \\nwhen he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be . \\nsoon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail . \\nthis complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor . \\nas the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely . \\ngray really lucked out with this cast . \\ndavid morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey . \\nthe only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a . \\nin l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land . \\nwith the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven . \\nalso in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides . \\nhis character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything . \\nfortunately , this doesn\\'t distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout . \\nj . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances . \\nsadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film . \\nwalsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon . \\nfor one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton . \\nwhen jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) . \\nthe negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing . \\nin the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it\\'s reality . \\nwe\\'re served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best . \\nas an audience , we\\'re also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we\\'d like to see if one will dominate the film . \\nboth provide some pretty good entertainment . \\n',\n",

don\\'t really feel there are to be any real \" rules \" for cinema ; a film can do anything , as long as it makes it work . \\nbut i do ask that all films have one thing in common : they create experiences . \\nwhen i watch a film , no matter what kind of film it is , i want to be able to take certain memories along with me . \\n \" the celebration \" is great because it\\'s chock full of those . \\nit creates a world so completely realistic that everything that occurs is as memorable as the little instances of life that catch your attention and stay with you for the rest of your life . \\nand then it makes things just a tad bit farscial , just to make sure you\\'re paying attention , which you are because what transpires is just so goddam interesting that if you were to ever feel bored , then you\\'re of your attention span needs a bit of a tuning-up . \\nthe story takes place at the extravagant home of an aging patriarch ( henning mortizen ) , who has just turned 60 and is having a party thrown for him . \\nall his friends and family turn up , and for the first half hour , we get introduced to everyone , simplistically and realistically ( no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here ) . \\nthe eldest son , christian ( ulrich thomsen , looking a bit like a young malcolm mcdowell ) , is the first to be seen in the film , walking to his father\\'s home . \\nhis brother , michael ( thomas bo larsen ) , drives by , pulls over , greets him , then kicks his family out of the car , forcing them to walk to the estate , just so christian can be comfortable . \\nwe then meet helene ( paprika steen ) , their sister , a woman who always seems to be stressed-out , who invites the driver of her car ( gbatokai dakinah ) , an american , to to come join her at the party she\\'s going to . \\nonce they\\'re all there and settled in , the party begins , and as custom , the eldest son has to make a speech to his dad , so christian stands up , at the head of the table , and reveals the film\\'s punchline : his father raped all his children at a young age . \\nbut since this is a family/friends affair , his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth , and is simply brushed off despite his efforts , and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir , and it\\'s all terribly interesting to watch . \\ntwists occur , and soon the film has taken on a nearly-farsical nature , but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends . \\nthe most notorious thing about this film , which has been getting the most notice , though , is that the director , thomas vinterberg has shot it in a completely awkward fashion . \\nas a member of the danish filmmakers clan , dogme 95 , a group that has vowed to oppose \" the auteur concept , make-up , illusions , and dramaturgical predictability \" so that they may \" purge film so that once again the inner lives

and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style , as ironically-showmanship as it really is , works perfectly for the nature of the film . \\nthe key , though , to this film , and the reason it\\'s not just a cool danish import , is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth . \\nthroughout the film , we see a completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies , a debate so three-dimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his the-truth-at-all-costs reasoning out of the water . \\nof course it was not right for the father to rape his children , and of course , they couldn\\'t have fought back then , and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them . \\nand yes , it\\'s thearapeutic for one to release the truth years later , when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier . \\nbut then again , the father , after all , is not a totally bad guy , and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier , we also see a man who has also learned to live with what he\\'s done , and deep down , feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface . \\nthe final scene , involving mortizen and everyone else , is utterly devastating , thanks to him and thomsen , whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex . \\neveryone else is flawless as well - the actors never seem to be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them . \\nthe actors or writers have not made the mistake to judge these characters in the slightest : there are no whites or blacks but instead all grays , exactly like life .

              " \"keep cool , a chinese film directed by semi-accomplished filmmaker yimou zhang , was one of the kickoff films for this year's hawaii international film festival . \\non the day it premiered , lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block , some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get a good seat in the theater . \\nthey need not have wasted their time . \\nthe movie is billed as a comedy , but is surprisingly bereft of humor . \\nthere are noticeable attempts at laughs , but very few tries actually click . \\ni wondered if there were jokes that i wasn't getting because i'm not from china , but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldn't be attributed to the cultural barrier either . \\nkeep cool just isn't very funny . \\nthe prelude to the film was a visit by keep cool's producer who , with the help of an interpreter , regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time , an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii . \\nalthough the print made it , the assistant's luggage was lost . \\ntoo bad that story wasn't in the movie , because it got a big laugh . \\nqu ying , the film's female lead , was also on hand to give a few comments . \\nhowever , whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up to speed , ms . ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one , fast-paced , incredibly long tirade . \\nit was dizzying ; good foreshadowing for the film . \\nyou see , keep cool is filmed almost totally with a camera handheld by a man with a bad case of the shakes . \\nat least that's the way it seems , since the camera is constantly moving . \\ncinema verite is one thing , but panning and shaking around until your audience has a headache is another . \\nalthough some might consider it a form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing , i found it thoroughly distracting , and after a while , quite annoying . \\nheadache , as i said . \\nthe film is about a young bookseller ( wen jiang ) who is after a young woman ( qu ying ) . \\nthey used to be romantically involved , but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship . \\nthe first half of the film is about the young man's plan to win her back . \\nof course the thing is , she doesn't want to be won back , and has a nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up a bit . \\nin the fight , the young man grabs a laptop computer belonging to a bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker , but only ends up smashing it against a lamppost . \\nwe later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced . \\nthere is a funny scene ( the only one in the film ) where the young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner ( baotian li ) in order to recoup his losses . \\nthere is no sense to be made out of the young woman's behavior ; cold one minute , caring the next , so we feel no sympathy for her character . \\nthe bookseller would be better off without her . \\nalthough the second half of the film causes us to lose a lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well , who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owner's hand as revenge for the beating he took , it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man . \\nwhile the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge , the older man is the voice of reason and tries to rationalize each situation . \\nhis quest to end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify with , but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to a brick wall half the time . \\na friendship develops between the two men , but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate . \\nalthough only an hour and a half in length , keep cool contains extraneous material . \\nthe whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out , since we don't see her from the midpoint on . \\na case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner , and would have saved us from the bookseller's boring pursuit during the first half . \\nbut of course , this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour . \\nthere are a few things that keep cool does right . \\nas mentioned before , the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good . \\nalthough it grows tiresome , the reasoning with the unreasonable is a nice exercise in logic , and represents the differences in thinking between generations . \\nin one scene , for example , the bookseller quotes confucius to get his point across , but the older man claims the quote was misinterpreted , and that it means something entirely different . \\nalso effective is the way zhang sets up tension within a scene , such as when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the hand of the unwitting nightclub owner . \\nthe nightclub owner is counting out money , slapping each bundle of currency on the table . \\nwith every shot of his hand , we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out his cleaver and exact his revenge . \\nunfortunately , these crumbs are not enough to overcome the rest of the film's shortcomings , and weren't enough to prevent that headache from lingering after i left the theater . \\n\",\n",
              " ' ( warning to those who have not seen seven : this review contains some spoiler information . ) \\nseven is a powerful , fully-realized film on the level of the silence of the lambs . \\nit is a disturbing film that accomplishes its biggest of goals--it occupies the viewers mind long after the closing credits have rolled . \\nwhile this film is not for the squeamish , there is no denying that seven demands attention , for it is a film that transcends its genre in both style and substance . \\nfor starters , classifying seven as a \" thriller \" would not be an altogether complete classification of this film . \\nwhile i was genuinely thrilled throughout , i would rather call seven an \" intense drama , \" because that is what it delivers--meaningful scenes with a relentlessness that does not readily let up . \\npart of director david finchers accomplishment is in style . \\nhe seems to have a knack for knowing exactly how the average person fears something as \" simple \" as a corpse . \\nand visually , fincher shows us the remains of murder victims in all-too-realistic and graphic terms ( courtesy of rob bottin\\'s always-grisly special effects ) . \\nthrow in the appropriate but not-to-be-underestimated effects of lighting and a foreboding score and the result is a technical masterpiece of the murder scene . \\nthese scenes alone are quite impressive ; as fascinating as they are harrowing . \\nyet , seven is more than just a technical accomplishment . \\nin addition to style , fincher supplies substance . \\nseven has compelling characters that it wants us to know and understand , and fincher ties them all together in a completely pessimistic view of society . \\ndetective william somerset ( morgan freeman ) is a man who has nearly given up on the world . \\nits easy to see why . \\nthe world doesn\\'t make sense . \\n ( somerset drives this point home with a rather ghastly story of a robbery victim who was attacked just blocks from the police precinct . \\nafter knocked down and robbed of his wallet , the attacker stabbed the helpless man in both eyes . ) \\nwhy should somerset believe that by following this murder investigation and \" picking up the pieces \" he will be able to catch the killer ? \\nsomersets new partner , david mills ( brad pitt ) has not given up on the world , perhaps because he is still young ( and perhaps by having this optimism he\\'s naive in this films portrayal of the world ) . \\nhe completely disagrees with somersets abandonment of hope . \\nhowever , david\\'s wife ( gwyneth paltrow ) has so much fear of her urban surroundings , she isn\\'t even sure if she wants to * tell * her husband about her recent pregnancy , let alone carry it until birth and attempt to raise it in this environment . \\nthese three characters are all performed with skill and authenticity that makes them feel like real people and not the typical hollywood characters a lesser film might have offered . \\nand in addition to making clear how each of these characters sees the world , fincher gives us support for * why * they feel the way they do . \\nbut if there\\'s one character that underlines the message seven is trying to convey , it has to be the killer , john doe ( kevin spacey ) . \\nseven\\'s payoff lies in its ability to allow us to see how the killer views the world and what drives him to do what he does . \\none important thing to remember about doe is how easy it is to simply dismiss him as a \" psycho , \" with no motives behind his slayings . \\nthis is exactly the mistake mills makes . \\nin the extremely intense and superbly performed closing scenes , were allowed to see that doe is , in his mind , merely a product of society . \\nhe\\'s a killer who kills those who are bringing society down . \\nin his mind he didn\\'t kill \" innocent \" people , and , perhaps , they were not completely innocent ( but , then again , who is ? ) . \\nhes absolutely infuriated that mills believes that the murder victims were innocent . \\nreally , seven doesn\\'t just comment on the superficial obviousness of how screwed-up john doe is . \\nseven makes larger statements about how screwed-up society is , hinting that society\\'s degradation is simply conducive of creating more john does . \\nbesides the stylistic and larger-issue arguments for seeing this film , i recommend seven because it is , after all , also a very slick and well-made thriller . \\nit features exciting plot developments , commanding performances , lots of suspense , and a conclusion that is chilling , riveting , and quite unfair . \\nbut then again , its a cruel world . \\n',\n",

              " 'the following review encompasses two versions of dune : \\ndune : the theatrical version ( 1984 ) runtime : 137 minutes capsule review : cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives , the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book . \\nthe film\\'s visual splendour , mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative . \\ndune : the extended version ( 1988 ) runtime : 189 minutes capsule review : a bit of a throw-together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television . \\nit was disowned by director david lynch but it\\'s considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline . \\nquality dubs of this version from the out-of-print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web . \\n * * * the review * * * \\nreleased in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of $40 million , the film of frank herbert\\'s cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci-fi fans . \\ndirector david lynch ( blue velvet , eraserhead , twin peaks ) was working on his biggest production to date , a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico . \\nthe screenplay was lynch\\'s own , chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected . \\ndune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors . \\nthe key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis ( dune ) , a windswept desert planet that\\'s home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange . \\nthe spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe . \\nit extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it . \\nmost importantly , it allows the navigators of the spacing guild ( once human but now hideously mutated ) to \" fold space \" and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously , enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish . \\nlynch\\'s film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story\\'s two main strands . \\none is the long-standing rivalry between two families , houses atreides and house harkonnen , and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis . \\nthe second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long-awaited by the natives of arrakis , the fremen . \\nthe deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld , and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom . \\nunfortunately , this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film , which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended . \\nthe thinking among universal\\'s oh-so-wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office . \\nwith lynch\\'s initial cut running at closer to three or more hours , the studio demanded that further cuts be made . \\nwhat a great idea ! \\nwhy not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible ? \\nthe most glaring consequence of this one-eyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative , leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters . \\nthus their personalities are vague , their motivations unclear and , in the case of paul\\'s father duke leto , their demise rather meaningless . \\nthe end result is a distinct chill : we can\\'t warm to most of the cast and we don\\'t care much for them . \\nand it hardly helps that the voice-over narration is sparse and that the dune-esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book . \\ndune is also a very serous film . \\nthe constant \" self-talk \" by various characters makes it so serious and self-absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment . \\nthe overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them . \\nhumour - or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen\\'s mad , sadistic kind - is hard to find . \\nyou may balk at the comparison , but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus\\' star wars trilogy . \\nthe theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster , however . \\nit still possesses enough of lynch\\'s stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative sci-fi . \\nspecial effects whiz carlo rambaldi\\'s giant sandworms are an awesome sight . \\nboth the production design ( anthony masters ) and costume design ( bob ringwood ) are striking and original . \\nand the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years . \\nwith these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis\\' lush cinematography , the film is at least a feast for the senses . \\nsee it in the widescreen format if you can . \\nand despite all the cuts , several cast members still make a strong impression , most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen . \\nsian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam , leader of the bene gesserit religious order who\\'s secret aim is to manipulate paul\\'s destiny for its own shadowy ends . \\nas paul atreides , the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily , but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade . \\nthe conclusion ? \\nany assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert\\'s original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker . \\ndavid lynch took a brave stab at it and , partly due to forces beyond his control , ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects . \\ndune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release . \\nmany chose to stay away altogether , as the film\\'s disastrous box office showing attests . \\nthe extended version , however , is a rather different beast . \\nin 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition \" director\\'s cut \" of the film on home video , a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres . \\nbut , alas , he failed to do so , choosing to move on to other projects . \\nin a way , then , it is partly lynch\\'s own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version , put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa . \\nstung into action , lynch successfully petitioned the director\\'s guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with \" allen smithee \" , the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work . \\nhe also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous \" judas booth \" . \\ncertainly , looking at the results of mca\\'s handiwork there\\'s at least half a dozen instances that , for sheer technical sloppiness , are good enough reasons for the director to object . \\nbut these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas . \\nmost of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration , both of which fill many holes in the original version\\'s storyline . \\npaul\\'s relationship with his father and associates is more intimate , with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously . \\nthe political skulduggery involving the emperor , the spacing guild , the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained . \\npaul\\'s initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably . \\nand as further background , a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe . \\nas a piece of storytelling , then , mca tv\\'s version of dune is clearly superior . \\nas a piece of editing , however , it is at times surprisingly inept . \\nthe use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough , but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate . \\nthere\\'s some sloppy cutting , too , and in a few instances shots even appear out of order . \\nand the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes ( eg . \\nships coming and going , soldiers coming and going ) is at times clearly out-of-context . \\nthis is the kind of thing to which lynch objected , and rightly so . \\nit should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u . s . television . \\nbut the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasn\\'t even in herbert\\'s book . \\nthe scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his \" heart plug \" . \\nits a surreal and disturbing episode that\\'s very lynch-esque but adds nothing to what we already know : the baron is a nasty piece of work . \\ndespite its own peculiar flaws , then , the extended version of dune is a generally superior film . \\nall up , it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered , fabricated or newly created sequences . \\nunless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart , the \" alan smithee \" version remains the closest we\\'ll get to what the movie should have been . \\non repeated viewings , one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit . \\nstill , as one of this century\\'s great science-fiction novels , some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved a better fate in its transfer to the screen . \\nwith rumours circulating of a new six hour mini-series planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998 , it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga . \\n',\n",

without it , this movie can\\'t go anywhere . \\nthe voiceover narration ( never one of my favorite techniques ) is too verbose and breaks into the story at undesirable moments . \\n ( however , without it , the final twist , which i will not reveal , would not be as poignant . ) \\nyet , despite these quibbles , i enjoyed oscar and lucinda . \\nstoryline faults pale in the light of two such finely-realized characters . \\nthematically , the film is also strong . \\nthe unifying motif -- that everything in life is a gamble -- is successfully delineated . \\noscar and lucinda don\\'t just wager their money , they bet their hearts , minds , and souls . \\na card game they engage in shortly after they first meet could easily be considered a form of emotional \" strip poker \" where defenses are peeled away to reveal their shared , secret passion . \\noscar does not see gambling as a vice . \\nin fact , he believes that the greatest chance one takes in life is betting one\\'s immortal soul on the truth of a religious faith . \\nralph fiennes , who normally plays strong , confident men , is very much at home as the fumbling , insecure oscar . \\nthe actor brings a variety of nervous tics to the part , all of which subtly add to a vague sense of discomfort whenever oscar is on-screen . \\nas good as fiennes is , however , he is eclipsed by cate blanchett . \\nthe actress , who appeared earlier this year as one of the leads in bruce beresford\\'s paradise road , is mesmerizing as lucinda . \\nshe gives this liberated woman her flash , and feeds the chemistry between the two lead characters so that it sparkles rather than fizzles . \\neffective support is provided by ciaran hinds ( the male lead in jane austen\\'s persuasion ) as lucinda\\'s close friend , tom wilkinson ( the full monty ) as oscar\\'s mentor , and clive russell as a self-serving adventurer . \\nthere\\'s a real magic in the way armstrong develops the story , keeping things moving in unexpected directions without lingering too long on any one moment or sequence . \\n ( in fact , i wish she had devoted a little more time to the luminous middle act , which has oscar and lucinda together . ) \\nwith the skill of a consummate storyteller , she weaves romance , friendship , passion , humor , and tragedy together into a complete package . \\nthe characters , with all of their human foibles and neuroses , are wonderfully developed by fiennes and blanchett . \\nso who cares if the storyline is a little ripe and unwieldy ? \\noscar and lucinda still offers abundant pleasures to reward the viewer . \\n',\n",
              " 'another formula \\'feel good\\' quirky comedy from the british isles , much like \" waking ned devine , \" and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line . \\nit is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin . \\nthe strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol . \\nthe film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas . \\nbut its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message . \\nits message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the \\'war on drugs\\' is about to be escalated into colombia . \\nthe drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future , it has so far just ended up causing america\\'s jails to be overcrowded with non-violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america\\'s drug usage and drug supply . \\nbillions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war , by backing a corrupt government ( remember vietnam ! ) with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country . \\neverything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war . \\nthe film\\'s mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never . \\nthere has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether . \\nthe film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle-aged woman , grace ( brenda blethyn ) , who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide . \\nthe widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined . \\nhe left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage . \\nthe widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband\\'s enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless . \\nshe also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london , honey ( quick ) . \\nwhat makes the affair doubly unsatisfying , is that when conferring with honey , she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her . \\neven though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can , the creditors swoop down on her like vultures . \\nher gardener and handyman , matthew ( ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check bouncing . \\nsince she is an expert amateur horticulturist , he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants , which he grows for private use . \\nthe two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity , as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high-quality stuff . \\nfor grace , this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt ; for the scotsman , matthew , it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky ( valerie ) . \\nthe locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed : the police sergeant ( campbell ) pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace\\'s greenhouse is for , the friendly vicar ( phillips ) counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can\\'t control , and the doctor ( clunes ) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation . \\nthe story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big-time drug dealer instead of having matthew go , because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn\\'t want matthew to end up in jail . \\nit is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail . \\nthe scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london , trying to find a drug dealer , while dressed out of place , in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal , was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole , whereby it never recovered its dignity . \\nthe film moves into the formula mode , whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive , as she meets an international drug dealer , a frenchman ( tcheky karyo ) , who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences , thereby becoming a celebrity . \\nthings work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood . \\nthere are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded . \\nthis \\'unhip\\' film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly , but should be tolerated as something naughty middle-aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute . \\nummm !

since he is the leader of the pack . \\nhe\\'s the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage , and then in another brilliant stroke , justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks . \\nhe\\'s so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process . \\nhis name is derek vinyard , and he\\'s played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks he\\'s almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as , say , malcom x . when we first see him , he\\'s clean shaven , with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast , a devlish goatee , and he\\'s attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets , at least when he doesn\\'t need them . \\nhe so believes in his convictions that he\\'s willing to put his beliefs to the test , even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison , if only for a couple years . \\n \" american history x \" is about derek , how he became a neo-nazi skinhead , how he rose to power , how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself , and how he tried to save others , namely his younger brother , from making the same mistake . \\nwe see him at all of these stages - as a smart teenager , a vicious hate monger , a man having an epiphany , and the man who tries to correct what he\\'s done before - and in all of these , we get a portrait of a man from all sides . \\nor at least , that\\'s the intention . \\nthe film\\'s framing device is his brother , danny ( edward furlong , perpetually looking about 13 ) , also now a skinhead , and how his principal , bob sweeney ( avery brooks , who i just found out was or is the captain on star trek\\'s deep space 9 ) , is trying to \" correct \" him . \\nwhen the film opens , danny has just written a book report on \" mein kampf , \" landing him in trouble with sweeney , which causes him to make him write a paper on derek\\'s life and how it has gotten him nowhere . \\ncoincidentally , this day is the day derek is released from prison , and when we see him , he\\'s cleaned-up , not as buff , and has a full head of hair . \\nhe\\'s just as intelligent , but still very rough along the edges , but he\\'s wisened up . \\nhe\\'s no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews , and tries to persuade danny , who\\'s becoming what derek was before , to give up his lifestyle . \\nbut danny won\\'t . \\nhe goes to a large skinhead beer bash , meets with the skinhead leader ( stacy keach ) , and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neo-nazi-dom as he was for it a couple of years ago . \\nthe film circles around this , then spins off into non-linear flashbacks , all done in black and white . \\nwe mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead , living in venice beach , organizing vicious and quasi-sadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white , middle-class teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work , and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on . \\nto them , the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop , and he not only speaks elloquently , forcefully , and intelligently , but he backs everything up with political reasons , justifying their rage at least to them . \\nand frighteningly enough , much of what he says sounds true . \\n \" american history x \" is a collection of really great scenes and moments , rather than a cohesive , great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next . \\nin it , there are some of the best scenes i\\'ve seen all year . \\none scene features a dinner between derek\\'s family , and his mother\\'s newest boyfriend ( played with reserve by eliott gould ) , a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek\\'s rightist views , launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience ( gould\\'s reaction to derek\\'s final summation is unnerrving ) . \\nanother scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black co-worker ( guy torry ) while folding laundry in prison . \\nand another soon-to-be-classic is actually divided in two : the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail , which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year . \\nthere\\'s much more to appreciate , like the acting , which is uniformly good , with stand-outs coming from avery brooks , beverly d\\'angelo ( as the long-suffering mother ) , and gould ( who has one horrible line , but other than that , comes off with the best performance he\\'s given in what seems like a really long time ) . \\nnorton walks off with the film , though , coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble . \\nin only the fifth movie of his career , norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation , and maybe the best . \\nthere\\'s nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie , spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention from the audience , coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando . \\nthat he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing . \\nsadly enough , this isn\\'t going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be . \\nit\\'s too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off as either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece . \\nthe ending , especially , is pencilled in from other movies , tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon . \\nsome of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches ( kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the \" fat skinhead , \" whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more ) , and even the dramatic arc isn\\'t as well travelled . \\nfurlong\\'s danny never seems to really be learning a lesson , since the flashbacks refuse to show his point of view , and when he decides to make a change by the end ( which was inevitable ) , it doesn\\'t seem like it has actually arrived there . \\neven derek\\'s descent into skinhead-dom doesn\\'t seem justified . \\nthough his fireman father ( william russ , the dad from \" boy meets world , \" and don\\'t ask me how i know that ) is killed by a black junkie , and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently , there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs . \\nas such , one can see why the director , tony kaye , wanted to have his name removed . \\nsorta . \\n \" american history x \" is a very good movie , and i was very moved by it , but it could be a lot better , and the problem seems to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential . \\nsomewhere , he claims , there lies a tony kaye cut , and that was to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton , who then ordered another cut , and that is thus . \\nalthough he aimed for the directing credit to go to \" alan smithee , \" the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by its director , it wasn\\'t allowed to him , under the grounds that once you disown a film , you can not badmouth it ( but really , that\\'s the macguffin - no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval ) . \\nkaye\\'s right in that it\\'s not up to par , even if he\\'s not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par . \\nthis will not be a \" do the right thing \" for the late 90s . \\nyet it still gets its point across intelligently , and backs it up with its story ( its message , that one cannot be so enwrapped in one\\'s own beliefs or pain and suffering will occur , is literally said over the narration , unfortunately ) . \\nand even if it isn\\'t perfect , at least when avery brooks turns to norton after he has been beaten and raped in prison , and asks him if anything he\\'s done has made his life any better , it realy hits a nerve , not only in derek , but also in the audience . \\n',\n",

if he\\'s not accepting illegal bribes from the insurance lobby or taking campaign contributions from the chinese , he\\'s making wind-bag speeches that start with the amusingly clintonesqe statement , \" america is standing on the doorstep of a new millennium . . . . \\nblah , blah , blah . \" \\nwhen the film opens , it is a few days before the 1996 primary elections , and bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he has become . \\nin a fit of desperation , he takes out a $10 million life insurance policy from a dirty insurance rep played by paul sorvino ( part of a shady lobby deal to kill a threatening bill in committee ) , and then hires a hit man to kill him , although he doesn\\'t know who the assassin will be , or when the hit will take place . \\nknowing that he will soon be dead , bulworth unleashes his own brand of political rhetoric on the world , which is made up of politically incorrect truths about the state of american politics and the society in general . \\nat a compton church , he tells the group of african-americans that they will have no power in the u . s . unless they \" put down that malt liquor and chicken wings , and get behind somebody other than a running back who stabs his wife . \" \\nlater , in a particularly hilarious sequence , bulworth mixes with the hollywood elite , then insults the quality of their movies and informs them that the only reason he\\'s there is because \" my guys always put the big jews on my schedule . \" \\nall throughout this physically and politically suicidal escapade , bulworth\\'s chief of staff , dennis murphy ( oliver platt ) , follows behind in a state of constant shock and bewilderment . \\nplatt has some of the movie\\'s funniest scenes , as he makes murphy into a politically savvy but nonetheless clueless assistant who is forced to watch his own career teeter at the brink of being flushed down the toilet . \\nhis constant half-truth-telling and spin-doctoring to cover bulworth\\'s stampede is equaled in its perversion only by a self-righteous reporter ( nora dunn ) who acts like murphy\\'s refusal to explain bulworth\\'s actions ( something he really cannot do ) is somehow an act of treason . \\nwhen bulworth decides he wants to live after all , and therefore must constantly evade a grim-looking assassin to be who\\'s trailing him at every turn , he hides out in the ghetto , complete with a stereotypical gangsta wardrobe which he wears to one of his television interviews . \\nat this point , beatty abandons much of the political aspect and dives into a cartoonish exploration of the black inner-city experience . \\nbulworth becomes friendly with a young black woman named nina ( halle berry ) , who he meets at the harlem church rally . \\nshe has a tough-talking brother who is deep in debt to a local gangster named l . d . \\n ( don cheadle of \" boogie nights \" ) , who also becomes involved in bulworth\\'s campaign . \\nsome of the scenes in the ghetto ring true , but much of it feels like a lighter version of scenes depicted in more intense inner-city films like \" boyz\\'n\\'hood \" ( 1991 ) and \" menace ii society \" ( 1993 ) . \\n \" bulworth\\'s \" chief liability is beatty\\'s insistence on having his character adopt a clumsy style of rap as his new communication device . \\ninstead of speaking at political rallies , he breaks into a kind of rhythmless rap style that is a reminder of why almost all hip-hop stars are black . \\nit\\'s hard to tell whether beatty is being humorous by being so bad , or whether he\\'s actually that incompetent . \\nat any rate , the rap sounds more run d . m . c . \\nthan snoop doggy dogg , which makes the film seem dated instead of contemporary . \\nbeatty would have been better off simply adopting some of the inner-city lingo and working that into his speeches , instead of trying to sound like l . l . cool j . \\nother than that , \" bulworth \" hits all its targets with wry , hilarious accuracy . \\nthe film is like a letter bomb to the democratic party , and even if you don\\'t agree with beatty\\'s liberal message about the unrequited duties of the federal government , it is hard to deny the impact the film has in exploring the monetary and moral debauchery that infests modern politics . \\nunlike \" primary colors \" which opened earlier this year , \" bulworth \" doesn\\'t try to tip-toe around the truly painful issues that hit close to home - instead , it takes them dead-on . \\n',\n",

\\nthe casting is fairly good . \\ntony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan ( and to my relief , the animators have succeeded in not making him another hercules . \\nnicely done ) , and glenn close is wonderful as kala ( she has a beautiful singing voice , too , by the way ) . \\nlance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson\\'s beast voice , which makes him all the more ferocious and gripping . \\nminnie driver had me a little worried at first as the voice of jane . \\ni thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film ( when i first saw the trailers ) , but when i saw the film , i didn\\'t have a problem with her . \\ni take back my insult on driver . \\nit\\'s nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for a disney animated feature ( he was fflewdurr flamm in disney\\'s most underrated classic , the black cauldron ) ; he is funny and delightful as professor porter . \\non the villiany side of the voices , brian blessed ( the guy who did boss nass in star wars : episode i-the phantom menace ) brings a pompous , and later on vicious , voice to the sinister clayton . \\nhe might not be the strongest character in the film ( he\\'s just a plain bad guy , nothing else ) , but blessed\\'s vocal work contributes greatly . \\nbut if there is any voice that i think steals the whole show , it should be rosie o\\'donnell , who is hilariously funny as terk . \\nshe also has a fiesty attitude ( \" i\\'m gonna kill ya ! \" \\nshe says , more than once ) . \\ni almost sung along with her during one of the film\\'s best moments , where the apes make a mess of the human\\'s camp , via song , er , scatting \" shoo-be-doo , da-be-dah \" . \\ni can see why she wanted to have a rock song for the film , she\\'s a good singer . \\nnot that she was the only funny character in the film , though . \\nwayne knight ( who played stan in space jam ) gives a whimsically funny style to tantor , an elephant who is especially worried about stepping into \" un-sanitary \" water . \\n ( thankfully , there is no real sound of flatuence-that would have killed the picture ) . \\nthe songs , as i said before , are decent , mostly sung by collins . \\nthis sets a new standard for disney animated films because for the first time , the characters do not sing . \\ni tolerate musical numbers from characters a lot more than some other guys would , but i found this to be a nice change of pace . \\nthe story does have elements of comedy in it , but they also load it with strong dramatic touches , which makes this film far better than the unbelieveably uninspired hercules . \\nif there is anything disappointing about tarzan , it might be the omission of the \\'n sync version of \" trashing the camp \" from the film . \\ni heard it on the soundtrack , and wondered where it was going to be . \\ni was upset that it wasn\\'t , because i had thought of taking a few friends of mine who like \\'n sync to see tarzan . \\noh , well . . . \\noverall , i was enthralled with tarzan . \\ni wouldn\\'t hold it high the way i do with mulan or the hunchback of notre dame ( my all-time favorite disney classics ) , but this film deserves a high place among disney\\'s greatest achievements . \\ni give a nod to disney for following up their spectacular * * * * * masterpiece , mulan , with this great animated adaption of egar rice burrough\\'s tarzan . \\n',\n",

\\nmuch of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompson\\'s book , and there are some priceless comic observations . \\nbut you\\'re hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work . \\nthis brings us to the performances , which strike me as all wrong . \\ndepp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george c . scott in patton - a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompson\\'s dialogue . \\nin between his several puking scenes , del toro fares better as dr . gonzo , but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost . \\nwatching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago , with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads - now that would have been something to see . \\nit\\'s interesting to note that alex cox , credited as a co-writer on the screenplay , was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over . \\nas much of a fan as i am of gilliam\\'s work , cox would have been the better choice . \\nsid and nancy , cox\\'s best work , covered essentially the same subject matter , but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film . \\ngilliam commits the compound sin of over-directing his film while being uncertain of his purpose . \\nwhat kind of movie was he trying to make , anyway ? \\nit doesn\\'t try to be a cautionary tale , and it doesn\\'t work as broad comedy . \\nif he had considered more carefully his purpose , the result would have been a much more interesting film . \\nbut i don\\'t want to be too hard on it . \\nthere are some truly funny moments , and if you\\'re in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it . \\ni do , however , recommend watching fear and loathing in las vegas under the influence of your favorite controlled substance - i guarantee it will enhance the effect . \\n',\n",

\\nbut species ii\\'s worst crime is being a thoroughly uninteresting piece of work . \\nat least the original featured plenty to laugh at--unaccountably awful performances by the otherwise fine actors ben kingsley and whitaker , and the sight of helgenberger\\'s character performing fellatio on madsen\\'s , for a start . \\nbut the filmmakers do not display any discernable effort at all , let alone the misguided effort that is required for something to reach the camp level . \\nfor all the blood and gore , nudity , and sex thrown in , species ii is , quite simply , a vapid bore . \\n',\n",

however , the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion-denying protagonist , stephane ( daniel auteuil ) . \\nstephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker . \\nhe is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing . \\neven the relationship between he and his boss , maxime ( andre dussollier ) is a controlled , and almost manipulated association , highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches . \\nin the beginning of the movie , stephane is a closed , solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man . \\ncamille kessler ( emmanuelle beart ) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes . \\nmaxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife . \\nlike stephane , camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved , sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges . \\nwhen stephane and camille meet , there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals . \\nhowever , whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane , stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him . \\nstephane ignores his feelings for camille , which the audience cannot help but to see is present . \\nas the movie progresses , the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another . \\nthese two people , with very similar approaches to life initially , react to their new circumstance very differently . \\nstephane becomes even more rational and controlled , while camille becomes more tempestuous , until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship . \\nhowever , their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation . \\nthe audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well , due to his relationship with a master violin teacher . \\nhowever , apparently , he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing . \\nconsequently , stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays . \\nin contrast , camille had almost given the violin , years earlier . \\nhowever , with the aid of her manager , she has progressed to being almost one of the world\\'s finest , successfully submerging herself to her playing . \\nduring the course of the movie , we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions . \\nstephane attempts to remain unchanged . \\nhowever , we do see subtle hints of his transformation . \\none of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash . \\nthe development of all of the characters , many of which is not included in this synopsis , is incredible . \\namerican movies , with rare exceptions , have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development . \\nin its essence , this movie is about the development and growth of the characters , camille and stephane . \\nthe portrayal of all the other characters in the movie , including a death , is to further the development of camille\\'s and stepahne\\'s characters . \\ni am not sure why berardinelli says , \" at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified , and it is to auteuil\\'s credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty . \" \\nthis movie is not about judging stephane\\'s actions as being right or wrong , but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are . \\ni find the ending appropriate ; unfortunately , i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling . \\nthis portion of the film is where the \" sense of closure \" could have been successfully accomplished . \\nunfortunately , there is a hurried and almost a soap opera-type surge of emotions from all of the characters . \\nwhile ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart , ravel has his day in this film . \\nthe synergism of the tension of ravel\\'s music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen . \\nthe directing in this movie is wonderful . \\nthe actors and actresses are excellent , each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth . \\nemmanuelle beart\\'s personality is beautiful . \\nand needless to say , i must say that emmanuelle beart , herself , is beautiful . \\nbesides the near ending , the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral . \\ni almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of . \\nthe one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot , has their attitude towards love changed ? \\ni have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at , but i am unsure of which the director is espousing . \\nin summary , this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship . \\nin the process , we see their attitude towards life and other people . \\nin itself , i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie . \\nwhere it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we , as americans , have preconceived american notions of relationship , love , and people . \\ni do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture . \\nhowever , i , bringing my american preconceptions , enjoyed the film . \\ni would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it . \\n',\n",

s are also the order of the day with mission to mars . \\ndialogue and character motivations are all lifted directly from countless other science fiction films that have all done it better and with more style ( even independence day , which lifted all of it\\'s premises from other sci-fi films was better than this film , and i don\\'t like independence day ) . \\nfilms like 2001 : a space odyssey , the abyss , and close encounters of the third kind are all blatantly stolen from ( and poorly at that ) . \\nthere is even a sequence where a rover is traveling through a canyon , and i couldn\\'t help but whisper \" u\\'tinni \" to myself and wait for a jawa to quickly hide in the rocks before the rover could get a glimpse of it . \\nthis film also features one of my all-time least favorite movie clich ? s : the \" he would have wanted you to have this \" moment , where one character gives another a trinket that yet another character is established as constantly having ( and is usually made fun of by the character who ends up getting all sappy over it later on ) . \\nscenes like these always bother me when they come out of nowhere in regular films , but in a film as clich ? ridden as this , it is particularly irritating . \\nennio morricone\\'s music is usually considered to be some of the best stuff in the projects he works on , but here it is dreadfully overbearing . \\nhis music sounds like it came straight out of a vincent price movie in certain scenes . \\nat other times his music is unbearably over-dramatic . \\none sequence involving a daring spacewalk rescue is given a particularly cheesy sting when it is discovered that the grappling hook device used for the rescue won\\'t reach its intended target . \\nmission to mars is push button filmmaking to the greatest extreme . \\nevents are set into motion that are obvious to anyone who has ever seen a movie and seem like they are just there to evoke an emotional response in the audience . \\nwe are apparently supposed to be upset that tim robbins character removes his helmet in deep space and kills himself to save his wife , but i felt extreme boredom coupled with a twinge of disinterest . \\nwhat makes it all worse is that fact that there is no real reason that robbins\\' character needs to turn himself into a popsicle , except to invoke an emotional response ( i could think of at least one way to save him , and the nasa clowns in this film are supposed to be \" smarter \" than i am ) . \\nduring the finale , when we are finally introduced to the translucent , conehead , kitty-faced aliens that we ostensibly sprung from , we are presented with some of the most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put to film ( just slightly worse than the plane crash at the end of air force one or the hell scenes in spawn ) . \\na brief history lesson about \" where we came from \" is proffered , then sinise is whisked away to be with \" the rest of our people \" ( he does this because his late wife proclaims in a video he watches early on that \" this is a chance to step foot where no one else has \" ) . \\n>from the press i\\'ve been seeing this film receive , it is apparent that mission to mars will be dying a quick death at the theater . \\ni\\'m sure the first weekend or two will be huge , but once word gets out people will stop going . \\nlet\\'s just hope the upcoming red planet is better than this and isn\\'t hurt by the negativity this film is generating . \\ni\\'d venture to say it won\\'t be worse than this waste of time . \\n[pg] \\n',\n",

              " 'i can\\'t recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota . \\nfor forty minutes or so , i was lured into a loopy if occasionally over-wrought romantic comedy , and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt . \\nthen , rather suddenly , i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence ; shortly thereafter , i was whacked in the gut by another . \\nfeeling minnesota is a film that made me feel violated , as though i had trusted writer-director steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face . \\nfeeling minnesota tells the story of a topless dancer named freddie ( cameron diaz ) who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss red ( delroy lindo ) suspects her of stealing from him . \\nred\\'s punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper , sam clayton ( vincent d\\'onofrio ) , who is far from the man of freddie\\'s dreams . \\nenter jjaks ( keanu reeves ) , sam\\'s estranged younger brother , who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddie\\'s eye and have sex with her in the bathroom . \\nunited in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam , jjaks and freddie take off together , but sam isn\\'t ready to let them go without a fight . \\nfreddie , meanwhile , isn\\'t ready to let sam\\'s money go without a fight , and thus begins a series of violent confrontations . \\nthere is both style and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota , as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks and sam\\'s intense sibling rivalry as boys , and their mother ( tuesday weld ) sending jjaks away to live with his father . \\nit does a great job of setting up jjaks\\' unstable life , a life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family ; reeves\\' wounded look is just right for jjaks . \\nthe wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments , most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin . \\nmost important , baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy , as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements\\' \" i will dare \" on the car radio . \\nyou would have every reason to expect that relationships -- both familial and romantic -- would be the focal point of feeling minnesota . \\nunfortunately , you would be dead wrong . \\ni suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding , but i certainly didn\\'t expect what i got . \\nwhat i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality , or rather creating gags about brutality . \\nsuddenly , the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes a story about a corpse , and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable . \\nthe sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another , but there is no consistency to the characterizations . \\nvincent d\\'onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam , whose jealousy , competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks , while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction , and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood . \\nthere are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully ( jonathan demme\\'s something wild and neil jordan\\'s the crying game come to mind ) , but they didn\\'t try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment . \\ni don\\'t want to dismiss baigelman\\'s successes out of hand -- he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop , and some well-crafted comic moments -- and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a light-hearted caper . \\nit _is_ his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value , and that he can\\'t make his two halves into a whole . \\nfeeling minnesota left me feeling used , and there\\'s not much funny about that . \\n',\n",

              " 'watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute \\'n cuddly , computer-generated monkey . \\nif the monkey died , the movie got an extra half star . \\nalas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs . \\nwhat that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars . \\nthat\\'s pretty generous , considering the movie\\'s camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek . \\nwhen will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it . \\nso why such a seemingly high rating ? \\nthere are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage . \\nfirst , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater . \\nthe sound and screen kicked ass . \\nnobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don\\'t necessarily mean that in a good way ) . \\nalso , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie\\'s tension . \\ni even liked the computer-generated settings . \\ni usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i\\'ve seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities . \\nalso , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain . \\nwilliam hurt isn\\'t too bad either . \\nneither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable . \\nand perhaps i shouldn\\'t admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood . \\nthere is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a \" real \" kiss -- no sex ) . \\nit felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six . \\nthose movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven . \\nthat type of moviemaking is a lost art . \\nnow for the bad news . \\nworst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue . \\nit\\'s squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction . \\n \" you better hold on to your joystick , \" is one such line . \\nand when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign . \\nsecond worst , and closely related , is the screenplay . \\nthe story\\'s exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what\\'s happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest . \\nonce the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived . \\nwhen gary oldman easily reprograms will\\'s pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : \" he flipped the switch to \\'evil . \\' \" \\nthen there\\'s the tone of the movie . \\nthe colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson . \\nthen it could be an adventure movie . \\nthey\\'re mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) wasn\\'t a good enough actor to carry it off . \\nstill , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination . \\njust because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn\\'t mean that we have to bow to a \" promise keepers \" notion of who\\'s the center of a family . \\nmany quality family films have been made with a non-traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect . \\nand the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie . \\nin star wars , the rebels were the good guys . \\nwe were rooting for those who were fighting against the system . \\nin lost in space , the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed and silenced so that our children may live free . \\nthat ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists . \\nfinally , a few specific details deserve criticism . \\nthe movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056 . \\nwhy ? \\nwhy bother saying what year this is . \\njust tell us it\\'s the future . \\ni bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 . \\nsetting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won\\'t be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the running anyway . ) . \\nthen there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole . \\nthis silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny\\'s barber chair , and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven\\'t learned a thing about ergonomics . \\none vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed : it made lost in space look cool . \\nthe strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and , out of context , made it sound hip . \\nthis is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie . \\nbut if that\\'s the best part of the movie , i can\\'t in good conscience recommend it . \\nstill , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies as a child , and bring along your \" bad movie bingo \" cards . \\n',\n",
              " 'here\\'s something to chew on : what\\'s the favorite food of big , cheesy-looking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising ? \\nthe obvious answer to this question is cardboard , because that\\'s the depth of the most fully- developed character in this painfully generic creature feature . \\ndeep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer . \\nin fact , considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas , perhaps it was . \\nthe most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore . \\nnot since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh ( both human and non-human ) been scattered in all directions . \\nwe learn some bloody trivia , as well , such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red ( it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains ) and what it does with half-digested leftovers . \\ni suppose deep rising\\'s gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre , but it doesn\\'t do much for me . \\non the surface , and that\\'s about the only level at which this film can be analyzed , deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic ( everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens/titanic connection , since james cameron directed both ) . \\nin going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongue-in-cheek mayhem of tremors , deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin . \\nthe film is not humorous , tense , or exciting . \\nin fact , it\\'s downright boring , and , despite being half the length of cameron\\'s current box-office champ , deep rising feels like the longer movie . \\nis it really necessary to say anything about the plot ? \\nprobably not , since it\\'s easy to guess , but i\\'ll go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis . \\nthe film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship . \\nin addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics , there\\'s finnegan ( treat williams ) , the boat\\'s pilot , who\\'s supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff ; joey ( kevin j . o\\'connor ) , the inept sidekick who\\'s supposed to be lovable and funny ( but is really just irritating ) ; and hanover ( wes studi ) , the \" mastermind \" ( and i use that term lightly ) of the operation . \\ntheir goal : attack a cruise ship , clean out the safe , then sink it using some illegally-acquired torpedoes . \\nthe problem is , by the time they reach the argonautica , the titanic-like luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste . \\naside from a beautiful jewel thief ( famke janssen ) and a couple of crew members , there\\'s no one on board . \\nthe reason soon becomes obvious -- the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles . \\nthe cast , which is led by treat williams , is primarily comprised of has-beens and probably-never-will-bes ( two exceptions : wes studi , best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans , and djimon hounsou , amistad\\'s cinque ) . \\nwilliams , once a \" can\\'t miss \" prospect in hollywood , has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising , and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career . \\nfamke janssen , who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye , is the perfect bland match for williams . \\ngiven her limited acting abilities , it\\'s likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes . \\nunfortunately , a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet tee-shirt for half of the picture . \\nmeanwhile , kevin j . o\\'connor , who has entirely too much screen time , exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard . \\nthese days , audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computer-generated special effects . \\nthis is a lesson that writer/director stephen sommers ( who previously helmed the live-action jungle book ) needs to learn . \\nthe days of jurassic park , when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen , are past . \\nnow , movie-goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic -- visuals that are so well-incorporated that it\\'s impossible to tell where they end and where \" reality \" begins . \\nin deep rising , the monster , like everything , is artificial and unconvincing . \\nunfortunately , the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isn\\'t so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture , but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre ( although , to be fair , deep rising is a particularly bad entry ) . \\neven once this film has sunk out of sight , the knowledgeable viewer knows it won\\'t be the last of its kind . \\nlike the slimy , slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies , more are waiting just around the corner in ambush . \\nand that consideration , unlike anything on screen , is truly horrifying . \\n',\n",

\" \\ncharacter and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays . \\nanyone who can\\'t immediately tell that bob gunton ( the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films ) is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised , but i highly doubt it . \\neven if he hadn\\'t been the villain in just about every film he\\'s ever been in , so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever . \\nin fact , his death is welcome , because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale . \\nif the plot doesn\\'t sound ridiculous to you yet , then check out these little tidbits : a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol . \\nan entire town disregards the sheriff and doctor\\'s orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated , causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force , killing several townsfolk . \\na government official blows off shelia\\'s instructions ( to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats\\' cave that will kill all of them off ) by pulling a night job , resulting in the death of an entire military unit . \\na cavern full of bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it . \\nfinally , to top it all off , this little texas town is showing nosferatu in it\\'s single screen theater ( for reference , our town has over a million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens , and we\\'re lucky to even get kevin smith\\'s dogma ) . \\nthe most laughable part of the movie though comes from the ill-conceived bat puppets . \\nwhile the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing ( making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend what\\'s going on ) , the scenes where a bat is called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shot more low-key . \\ntherefore we the audience get loving close-ups of the most unrealistic , rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film . \\nbeing able to see the puppeteer\\'s arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse . \\nafter all of this , if you still decide bats might be the movie for you , don\\'t say you haven\\'t been warned . \\ntrust me when i say that it\\'s a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through . \\ni just wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in . \\nshe\\'s definitely a talent that is going to waste in films like these . \\n',\n",

              " 'it seemed like the perfect concept . \\nwhat better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? \\nit\\'s exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh . \\njim carrey\\'s signed on too ? \\neven better . \\nthe national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers\\' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as \" schizophrenia , \" and so forth . \\nsuch a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers\\' fire , proving that some people just couldn\\'t take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy . \\nyes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn\\'t funny . \\nit\\'s not for lack of trying . \\nthe farrellys utilize in \" me , myself & irene \" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them . \\nthis , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult . \\nsoon enough , charlie\\'s repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster . \\nthis guy isn\\'t above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he\\'s been insulted , or holding a little girl\\'s head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street . \\nthen things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks . \\nsome have suggested that this isn\\'t a problem , because the farrelly brothers\\' brand of humor doesn\\'t require plot to work . \\nthey\\'re wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys\\' last effort , 1996\\'s \" there\\'s something about mary . \" \\n ( 1999\\'s \" outside providence \" was technically an earlier project . ) \\nthe brothers\\' earlier film wasn\\'t funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected . \\nin \" mary , \" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they\\'d have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion . \\n \" me , myself & irene , \" by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at \" mary \" and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work . \\nhaving been produced by the same guys who made \" mary , \" \" irene \" seems like an even bigger disappointment . \\nthe brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes . \\nbut they haven\\'t come up with a way to make any of it fresh ; most of \" me , myself & irene \" comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy . \\nthe plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who\\'s in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that\\'s entirely predictable from the get-go . \\n ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? \\nyeah , me too . ) \\nthe farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven\\'t already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be . \\ncompared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it\\'s no longer funny , merely gross . \\nthe jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry . \\ntake , for example , the subplot involving charlie\\'s three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) . \\nthe incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face . \\nbut by the end of the film , they\\'re still doing the same schitck ; it hasn\\'t been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn\\'t been dropped either . \\nthat\\'s too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . \\n \" me , myself & irene \" reeks of wasted opportunities . \\nthere ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie\\'s new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank\\'s actions . \\nthis doesn\\'t really happen ; nearly every supporting character learns about charlie\\'s condition early on , so they don\\'t have any opportunity to be surprised by it . \\nthe film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , \" whitey \" ) , but the script doesn\\'t go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax . \\njim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he\\'s left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in \" all of me . \" \\nit\\'s a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny . \\ncarrey doesn\\'t pull any stunts we don\\'t expect him to pull , and the farrellys\\' script doesn\\'t give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren\\'t set up in any meaningful way . \\nperhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . \\nzellweger\\'s irene is not a strong female lead ; mary in \" mary \" may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed . \\nirene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she\\'s ditzy , clever , or neither . \\nas such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only \" sane \" person in the film . \\nchris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this . \\nhe , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected . \\nafter viewing the shapeless mess that \" me , myself & irene \" eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . \\nmaybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . \\nbut i don\\'t believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . \\nif the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they\\'ll rebound just fine . \\neven after that happens , though , i\\'ll still consider \" me , myself & irene \" to be a high-caliber misfire . \\n',\n",
              " 'i was pleasantly surprised by this film . \\nwith a budget topping $200 million , i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century\\'s greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see . \\nhow much could you dress up the sets ? \\nhow many models and computer effects could you use ? \\nhow much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks ? \\noh , if i\\'ve just given away part of the plot for you , go back to school . \\nafter having viewed titanic , however , i found it to be a well-paced , well-designed , and overall well-made movie . \\nthere have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic , but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i\\'ve seen . \\ntitanic tells its story in two time periods . \\nit starts out in the present , when ocean explorer brock lovett ( bill paxton ) and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic , searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship . \\nwhat they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace , which is broadcast on the news . \\nthe woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett , who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas . \\nthere she tells her story to lovett and his team . \\nin 1912 , rose dewitt bukater ( kate winslett ) , a young lady belonging to society\\'s upper class , boards the titanic for the ship\\'s first atlantic crossing , from southampton , england to new york . \\nshe is engaged to cal hockley ( billy zane ) , an heir to old money , and a snob in every sense of the word . \\non board , rose feels the stifling trappings of high-society\\'s expectations , and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanic\\'s stern , but is saved from her self-proclaimed fate by jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a passenger in third-class ( \" steerage \" , as it\\'s referred to ) , who talks her out of jumping . \\nalthough for rose the attraction is not immediate , a love affair soon develops between the two , which endangers rose\\'s social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal . \\nthe story sounds very simple , and perhaps even unexciting , but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron , a good movie comes through . \\ndicaprio is marvelous as the young , but worldly-wise jack , playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors . \\nhis is a character that is immediately likable , as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle a variety of situations . \\ngirls are going to swoon over him . \\nwinslet also proves herself a good actress , delivering her lines convincingly , and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable . \\nthe only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her character\\'s upbringing . \\nsimply by judgment of her gait , i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an upper-crust debutante . \\nrather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess , she sometimes looks positively clumsy , and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting . \\nbilly zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal , since he has a certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him . \\nhis features are such that even when he smiles , there\\'s something mistrustful about him , and when he scowls , he is evil incarnate . \\nhe\\'s something like a porcelain version of peter gallagher , but a cheaper model . \\nlike dicaprio and winslet , zane slips comfortably into his role and plays it well . \\nbacking up zane is david warner as lovejoy , cal\\'s personal assistant ( or \" man \" as they said at the turn of the century ) . \\nno matter who else is in the cast , you can always count on a good performance by warner , who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel and will to match . \\nadditionally , there are a number of smaller fictional and non-fictional roles thrown in for color , such as kathy bates as \" the unsinkable \" molly brown , danny nucci as jack\\'s friend fabrizio de rossi , eric braeden as john jacob astor , and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie . \\nnice to see dr . bombay getting work . \\nalso scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die . \\nthis by itself may have been largely compulsory in a film about the titanic , but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict with the ship\\'s crewmembers who strive to maintain order and assure that the first-class passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else . \\nin this way , titanic possesses a depth not usually found in action pictures . \\nyou don\\'t just get a love story with a tragedy as a backdrop , but a very real account of class struggle as well . \\nas i mentioned before , the budget for this film was tremendous , and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects . \\nthe interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail , and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic . \\nwith regard to the exteriors , i would dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale . \\ncameron actually built a scale model of the titanic in a water tank , but only had room for 90% , and therefore had to computer-generate the remaining 40 feet . \\ncould\\'ve fooled me and everyone else in the theater , as the splicing is seamless . \\nalso of note in this film is the way the audience is presented with the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning . \\nwe are told of where the iceberg struck the ship , how the flooding occurred , the way the ship sank , and why it did so in that manner . \\nthese technical details serve as a guide for later on when the action starts happening , and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction , in addition to the more conventional placement in the midst of mayhem and confusion . \\nin all , james cameron\\'s titanic is a good blend of love story , history , and action . \\nthe fact that the film runs longer than most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewer\\'s attention is held alternately by those three main elements , from the movie\\'s intriguing beginning to it\\'s satisfactory ending . \\nin box office receipts , titanic the movie will undoubtedly live up to the unsinkable expectations of titanic the ship . \\n',\n",

\\nprince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive , hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet , as well as a handful of intense performances , most notably by treat . \\nlumet\\'s greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back , and lets the camera soak up the action . \\nhis scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension , and he rarely holds for reaction shots , instead he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking . \\nlumet\\'s worst tendency is one that many film makers ( especially oliver stone ) tend to overuse : he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension . \\nthis isn\\'t as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan , lumet\\'s most recent cop \\\\ lawyer endeavor , a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching . \\nthough of late lumet has made several really awful career choices ( maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something ) , the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria , here he was on , sustaining tension in a film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot . \\nsome of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic . \\nhollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable . \\nof course cop movies aren\\'t popular anymore ( yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines ) , but just look at the average hollywood action movies , flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn\\'t gay , the lame comic relief character who\\'s never funny , and on and on . \\nfor all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a back to the basics cop \\\\ courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills . \\nit focuses completely on its story , and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies . \\nthere\\'s a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if he\\'s about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches , but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing . \\nthis is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film ( even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon , not one damn tear ) it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human , excuse me , weak . \\nin the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness , straining to get the words out . \\nhe\\'s lost his voice . \\ndoes that little itty bitty detail matter ?

              " 'after a rather disappointing \" mary railly \" , stephen frears is now officially back in business with a comeback worthy of praise . \\nthis is one of the best surprises of this season -- a sweet , small budget comedy with a big heart . \\nin fact it\\'s not even a comedy . \\nit\\'s a drama or even more precise -- a clever satire on human relationships and needs . \\nbased on a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by british author nick hornby , ``high fidelity\\'\\' is a wry and likable story about a man\\'s quest for fulfillment and happiness . \\nrob gordon was a dj . \\nit seems that he could make everything spin -- except his own life . \\nnow he owns championship vinyl , a little musical store , somewhere in new york . \\nwhen he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend , a gorgeous blond attorney , life suddenly looses every purpose . \\ndecimated , humiliated and on the verge of a mental ( and emotional ) breakdown , he starts meditating over his life and the way it could have been -- about what\\'s right and what\\'s important . \\nhe starts \" categorizing \" life , dividing it into \" top 5 lists \" . \\nand the most important is the \" top 5 list \" over the most painful breakups of his life , starting with 5th grade , when he found his young girlfriend with another boy . \\nthough you might think that people change , grow more mature with age , it just doesn\\'t seem that way and all rob\\'s relationships were different versions of that first . \\nwhere did he go wrong ? \\nwas it he that screwed up ? \\nor maybe life just stinks ? \\nwhile he is lost in his own self-pity , he must think of the \" top 5 list \" over his needs for the future , find the right elements and mix his life together . \\nwith clever parallels to the cult of celebrity , music and with incredibly direct narration , it addresses the average audience member , in other words -- people like you and me . \\nalthough a lot of this honor should be addressed to the screenwriter ______ and frears , the director , the acting is equally important as the written word . \\nand here john cusack should absolutely be mentioned . \\nhe is simply superb . \\nit is as much his movie as it is frears\\' . \\nthe film would not be the same without him . \\ncusack -- whose character is sadder , wiser and 35 -- brings intelligence and warmth to post- mod irony . \\nmost of his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera -- not an easy task -- but cusack pulls it off . \\nhis interpretation feels so emotionally right , so incredibly realistic and precise that frears\\' message simply can\\'t be ignored or overseen . \\nthe other members of the cast do an equally remarkable job . \\nboth ______ and jack black are fabulous . \\neven catherine zeta jones appears in a role where she actually acts , not just looks beautiful . \\nhowever , the most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided by todd louiso who delivers a spectacular comic performance as rob\\'s co-worker and friend dick . \\nthis is such an impressive achievement that it\\'s almost worth a oscar-nomination . \\nhe is simply a joy to behold . \\notherwise , everyone are in their place , and at the right time -- all part of frears\\' colorful blend . \\npretty much like edward norton\\'s \" keeping the faith \" , this film doesn\\'t follow any formula or belong to any genre -- it\\'s dramatic , tragic , sarcastic , comic and even cynical , but never bitter or angry . \\nit\\'s a little bit of everything , pretty much like life itself . \\nnothing seems unreal or staged . \\nit reflects reality as a mirror . \\nas you watch it , you go through the same emotional problems as the main character . \\nyou feel and think and reflect . \\nthis effect has become a rarity nowadays . \\nalthough it\\'s primarily about the perils of love , ``high fidelity\\'\\' is secondarily about pop music . \\nrob owns championship vinyl and his employees , timid dick ( todd louiso ) and overbearing barry ( jack black ) , are fellow music snobs . \\nmusic is the language in their lives , the measure by which they define themselves and mark the significant events of their lives . \\nand so does the movie . \\nit is as much a musical film as anything else , as rob\\'s journey is wonderfully portrayed through carefully inserted musical fragments . \\nin the end , you have gained something while watching it . \\nit\\'s not the film of the century or even of the year . \\nit\\'s not an special effects extravaganza . \\nit doesn\\'t require big explosions or digital creatures to succeed . \\nit\\'s a small movie about the big things . \\nand even though it does not contain heavy philosophy , you feel as if you have experienced something of significance , and you will experience that nice warm feeling for quite some time . \\n',\n",
              " 'i rented \" brokedown palace \" last night blind , having heard nothing about it beforehand , and i enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws . \\nfor anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety . \\nthat is no easy task . \\nsuperficially , it bears an unfortunate ( and not necessarily unintended ) resemblance to several other movies , notably \" return to paradise \" and \" midnight express . \" \\nas a result nearly every review of \" brokedown palace \" i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons . \\nthe consequence was nearly universal condemnation , which is a shame as this is a fine film . \\nfor those who have yet to view the movie , let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system ( as was \" midnight express \" ) nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of \" return to paradise . \" \\nin my view , if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad\\'s acclaimed novel , \" lord jim . \" \\nproblematically , the basic storyline seems more than familiar : two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set-up involving a suave con-man , a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world \" justice \" system . \\nthe girls are alice ( claire danes ) and darlene ( kate beckinsale ) . \\nthey\\'re life-long buddies who planned a high-school graduation trip to hawaii , and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents . \\nonce there , they find a $6 hotel and go sight-seeing , which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside . \\nthey get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room , a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them , but they are saved from hotel security by a charming , friendly australian , nick ( daniel lapaine ) , who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution of the girl\\'s scam . \\nhe then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves , first toward alice , then toward darlene . \\nby now alarm bells are going off among viewers . \\nthe ever-present nick is too slick and his stories don\\'t add up ( to us ) --the girls , of course , are too naive to notice . \\nlong before it happens , we\\'re anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast-talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting-ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag ( literally ) containing heroin . \\njust as predictably , the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison-bound for a long stretch . \\nleft unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice . \\nfor those in need of a ready answer , might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl\\'s fleabag hotel . \\nas one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed , the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer/fixer \" yankee hank \" ( bill pullam ) and his thai-born partner-wife . \\na recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the film\\'s tag lines , \" who do you trust ? , \" and hank is no exception although seasoned movie- goers and those familiar with pullman\\'s oeuvre will find few surprises . \\nmuch of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short-hand fashion . \\nlou diamond phillips , for instance , plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who , while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank , withholds vital information at crucial moments . \\nis he part of a wider conspiracy ? \\nwith an inherently powerful , if somewhat tired premise , the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama , a prison story , and a potential character study of american teens , their relationship , and what constitutes friendship between them . \\nthe result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful , with the girls\\' interaction , hank\\'s investigation , and the various trials and hearings , offering hope for their release , delivering tension--as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape . \\nif \" brokedown palace \" has a major flaw , it is its creators\\' tendency , like time-constrained tourists , to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half-way down and return to the story\\'s main avenue . \\nand , if that were all there was to \" brokedown palace , \" it wouldn\\'t be a very good movie . \\nbut i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and , in this , they succeeded . \\nfor the main theme of the movie , like the proffered name of its location , is freedom--in all its permutations . \\nultimately , the other sub-themes may be considered window dressing . \\nyoung and pretty , alice ( danes ) is an old soul ; a wild , streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom and adventure . \\npresented as a perfect blend of yin and yang , dark and light , is her cautious best friend , darlene ( beckinsale ) . \\nclear-eyed and straightforward , alice is more complex than her friend . \\nshe comes from a poorer background , has a reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone ( including her own father ) . \\nwhereas darlene\\'s life is \" on-track , \" aimed at college , marriage , kids , a career , a suburban home , middle age and \" fulfillment , \" alice\\'s is uncertain , unfocused , and yearning . \\none poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors--friends and relatives from home , whose lives continue while hers is in limbo . \\ntellingly , alice is present but not included . \\njust as revealing of their different personalities , when alice and dar first come to thailand , the openness and delight on alice\\'s face doesn\\'t read as simple naivet ? ; the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in a small boat , reaching toward the sun , she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom , while \" dar \" remains seated in the shade . \\n \" brokedown palace \" begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank . \\nhowever unintentional , it\\'s all alice\\'s fault . \\nshe\\'s responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents , to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand , to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick . \\n ( in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a film\\'s beginning , darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison . ) \\ndar , of course , is the willing dupe which , in her view , confers innocence . \\nnever mind that it was her coercion of a reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate . \\ndar is innocent . \\nit doesn\\'t matter . \\nalice is the subject of this movie . \\nshe and her journey toward personal freedom . \\nalong the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half-baked sensibilities and materialistic goals . \\nin the end , that culture , like its representatives , \" yankee \" hank and dar\\'s father ( a \" man who knows how to grease the wheels \" ) , proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girl\\'s tragedy . \\nthailand\\'s culture , contrary to most opinion , comes off much better by comparison . \\nit amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes . \\ni believe the filmmaker\\'s view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior . \\nthe thai ( with the sole exceptions of a corrupt official and a spiteful prison spy ) were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principles . \\nthe girls were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the native-born . \\ntheir prison ( in stark contrast to the probable reality ) was no hellhole , being relatively clean and sunlit . \\nthe prison authorities demanded good hygiene , provided medical care when needed , and \" hard manual labor \" consisted of picking grass ! \\nthe thai guards were authoritarian ( what else ? ) but certainly not routinely sadistic . \\nas for the thai justice system , the reasoning of the thai judges , during both an appeal hearing and in the film\\'s penultimate scene was devastating in its logic and morality . \\n\\'freedom\\' has many faces and \" brokedown palace \" explores many of them . \\nin the extreme , we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit . \\nsome settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter . \\nbut freedom seldom comes without a price . \\nwhich is why the movie\\'s other tag lines are : \" what is your dream ? \" \\nand \" how far would you go ? \" \\ni believe i could make a good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom , incarcerated or not , by film\\'s end is alice . \\nshe finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility . \\ni think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact . \\nkate beckinsale\\'s character might more properly be likened to the \" released \" temple bird referred to twice during the film , \" trained to fly back to its cage . \" \\nas the thai magistrate observed in the film\\'s climactic scene , the issue was always one of \" character ; \" and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that \" freedom \" is achieved within oneself . \\nif one thinks back over the movie , which character was transformed by their experiences ? \\nincreasingly , the cinema landscape seems to have become littered with endless permutations of \\'kung fu woman\\'--female characters virtually indistinguishable from male action figures . \\nhere , at last , is the story of a modern heroine . \\nin reading the many user\\'s comments , i was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon : whether or not a person liked the movie , almost everyone praised the actors . \\nthink about that . \\nwhen was the last time you came away from a motion picture possibly hating it , but raving about all the performances in it ? \\ndo yourself a favor : rent \" brokedown palace \" and watch it with a open mind . \\nthere\\'s more there than meets the eye . \\n',\n",
              " 'synopsis : private detective tom welles is hired by a wealthy widow to uncover the origins of a snuff film owned by her late husband . \\nafter uncovering the authenticity of the film , welles descends into an underground world of perverse pornographers seeking vigilante revenge on the filmmakers . \\ncomments : 8 mm is one of the more disturbing mainstream movies i have seen in a long time . \\nthough it doesn\\'t present a snuff film ( a movie which documents a person\\'s murder for real , usually during or after some form of sexual act ) as explicitly as the cult classic mute witness and violence as shockingly as , say , natural born killers , 8 mm stays in your head long after you see it . \\nit is not fun to watch ; see something else if you get upset by realistic , sadistic violence . \\nthis film\\'s violence and perverse sexuality skirts closely into nc-17 territory . \\nfor those with strong stomachs , however , 8 mm is an intelligent , worthwhile thriller , especially during its second hour . \\nnicolas cage , after a couple ho-hum movies , returns to material which allows him to utilize his strong acting abilities . \\nas tom welles , a private detective and caring family man to a wife and newly-born daughter , cage skillfully and convincingly portrays a decent man whose unwavering energy slowly transforms into obssession and violence as he is pulled into a nightmarish world of underground pornographers and brutal sexual deviants . \\nserving as a guide to this world is joaquin phoenix , who plays a struggling songwriter named max california . \\ncalifornia , despite his name , is a surprisingly intelligent and complex character , and phoenix does a very good job at slowly pulling the audience to sympathy for the character . \\nthe real star of the movie , though , must be peter stormare . \\nstormare played the \" really , really evil guy \" in fargo , and his character , dino velvet , in this movie seems about ten times more evil and unpredictable . \\nhis performance is very chilling . \\n8 mm\\'s success may hardly be surprising . \\nit was directed by joel schumacher , who , hopefully , saw this film as an apology for the absolutely dreadful batman and robin . \\nbefore directing the last two batman duds , however , schumacher was responsible for several well-made horror flicks : lost boys , flatliners , and falling down . \\n8 mm certainly joins the rank of these minor classics and is perhaps most reminiscent of falling down in that both films present an average man who self-destructs before the audience\\'s eyes . \\n8 mm was written by andrew kevin walker , who also penned the academy award-winning thriller seven a few years back . \\nlike seven , 8 mm is full of dialogue which haunts you well after leaving the theater . \\nwelles is searching for answers . \\nhow could anyone possibly drug and then slowly , methodically , sadistically kill a teenaged girl to make a film ? \\nwhen confronting one of the perpretrators at the end , the murderer responds that there are no reasons . \\nhe just enjoys it . \\nthat , walker seems to suggest , is where the real terror lays : not in the crime itself but in the fact that rational motives do not exist . \\na couple minor faults led me to my four-star rating ( five stars is the highest rating i give ) . \\none , i found it a little difficult , early on , to accept the fact that a hardened private detective would get physically disgusted when first seeing a snuff film . \\nyes , snuff is a horrible thing , but a detective of welles\\' caliber has probably encountered awful things before . \\nsecond , some of the clues welles gathers are too convenient . \\nhe discovers , for example , the victim\\'s diary in her private bathroom , despite the fact the the police , the fbi , and her own mother have all investigated the room before . \\nfinally , the closing scene seemed trite and improbable considering the rest of the film . \\ndespite the above criticisms , 8 mm is an engrossing story . \\none of the best scenes in the film occurs toward the end as a crazed welles , who no longer seems like a hero , brutally beats one of the pornographers responsible for the snuff film . \\nhe pulls a gun on the man and , for a relatively long amount of time , struggles to decide whether or not to kill him . \\nhe then leaves the building and calls the victim\\'s mother , in the middle of the night , to basically see if she would support the action . \\nthe entire scene is tense , unpredictable , and emotionally charged . \\nrarely , anymore , do horror films or thrillers provoke suspense in me as 8 mm , with scenes like this , did . \\n8 mm is most certainly not for the faint of heart . \\nthis is a graphic , oftentimes unflinching , look into the darkness which resides in both ordinary and extraordinary people . \\nif you\\'re prepared for a film of this nature , i give it an enthusiastic recommendation . \\n',\n",

\\nthe answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty . \\nthere\\'s no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be . \\nanother problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film . \\ni was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters . \\nand jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast . \\nunlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you\\'ll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive \" teenage mutant ninja turtles . \" \\nfurthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot . \\noddly , this isn\\'t just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids . \\nwell , he\\'s done a good job . \\nthe hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy . \\nthat\\'s not jake lloyd\\'s fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him . \\nthat\\'s another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader . \\nwarning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! ! \\nin my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin\\'s future evil in the film . \\nthe boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there\\'s nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie . \\nhe has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine . \\nbut the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn\\'t all hearts and roses is yoda\\'s hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui-gon jinn . \\nhis explanation ? \\n \" his future is clouded . \" \\n ( warning : major spoiler ahead . \\nenter at your own risk . ) \\nof course , the noble qui-gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary-looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side . \\nthis dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double-sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup . \\nbecause qui-gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi-wan , qui-gon\\'s young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself . \\nso , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi-wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin \" darth vader \" skywalker . \\ndid this story need to be told ?

              " \"those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely to be surprised by the fact that i have not read victor hugo's novel les miserables . \\ni don't know if a lot of people have , though i imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel . \\ni haven't even seen that . \\ngoing into this film , i had almost no knowledge of the story or its characters ( i even expected the film to be a musical ) . \\nwalking away from it , i'm kind of glad i had no prior experience with the material . \\nwriter/director bille august's film version is a straightforward , beautifully told film . \\nliam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean ; in the beginning , he has just been released from a 19-year prison sentence . \\nhe is allowed to stay in a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude and destructive behavior . \\nthe priest's words of wisdom influence him , and he makes a vow to change himself . \\nnine years later , we are informed that he is now the mayor of a town called vigo ; nobody knows his real name , and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago . \\nconflicts arise when inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is assigned to vigo . \\nvaljean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beat him , and javert remembers jean to be a convict . \\njavert is hell-bent on upholding the law , and he does everything in his power to bring jean to justice . \\nalong the way , valjean meets and falls in love with a peasant woman , fantine ( uma thurman ) , and vows to take care of her daughter , cosette ( played later by claire danes ) . \\nles miserables is visually a solid and often striking picture . \\nthe production design by anna asp is authentic and vast , and the sets don't look like sets ( they look like real towns and villages ) ; gabriella pescucci's costumes are noticeably spectacular . \\nbasil poledouris' soundtrack is thick and usually well-placed ( though it does get a bit heavy at times ) . \\nmany scenes in the film have a memorable photographic quality , such as the climax , which takes place next to a dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening . \\naugusts keeps the story simple ( which i hear is a good thing , since the novel is so complex ) and easy to follow . \\nhe manages to develop the main characters and most of the subplots adequately . \\ni was also impressed that he didn't go overboard with flash and style , which is something so many directors seem to be doing to classic stories these days ( such as baz luhrmann's vicious tragedy william shakespeare's romeo + juliet ) . \\nthis film feels solid and whole , and each scene has a certain amount of importance and vigor that keeps the audience interested . \\nliam neeson is terrific in the main role ; neeson is the kind of actor who does solemn desperation extremely well , and valjean is certainly a man who clearly fits that adjective . \\nthurman , in her small role , is very good , and proves that she has a lot of range and can perform in a very non-glamorous role such as this one . \\nrush is absolutely incredible as javert ; i don't remember ever feeling so strongly about a villain as i do here ; he adds depth and complexity with subtle glances and nuances , and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense . \\ni can't be as charitable for danes , however ; though i know she is a talented actress , here she tends to overact when it might have been better to underplay the character a bit . \\nles miserables is , as i've said , a solid , intelligent motion picture . \\nmy only complaint is that it feels a bit too easy , and perhaps too staged . \\neach scene is grand and huge , and exploding with poledouris' score , but i didn't always want them to be . \\nfor the most part , les miserables is not a subtle or deep picture . \\nit's a good movie , and tells its story well , but august tends to hand-feed us themes and scenes that would have worked better had they been more subtle . \\nhowever , in a film this exciting and well-produced , a few minor flaws are easily overlooked . \\n\",\n",

and del toro are ? going to pull out guns and scare them away but they don\\'t , instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by a mob . \\nthere\\'s a lot of things i didn\\'t understand about this scene : first of all the owner of the mercedes isn\\'t some yuppie or old rich snob , he\\'s like a hippie straight out of the 60s . \\nsecondly , the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed . \\nlastly , it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than a small country\\'s army . \\nif they were suicidal they wouldn\\'t have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place ( and where they get all those guns is never explained either ) . \\nthere\\'s a lot more i could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility . \\nwhat it all comes down to is that nothing here is what it seems - which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is . \\nabsolutely none of the characters are likable or believable . \\nand it\\'s all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is good for a chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not a flat-out black comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill screen time . \\nwith any film you see , whether you like it or not , you can at least understand what the appeal was to it , why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it . \\ni can\\'t say either for \" the way of the gun , \" because it has very little going for it and i can\\'t imagine anyone intelligently defending it . \\n',\n",

\\nred , white , and blue ? \\nhuh ? \\nhuh ? ) , and go on a road trip where three things happen , in no order : 1 ) they have sex ; 2 ) they run into weird people ; 3 ) they kill them . \\nthe film is basically a remix of a bunch of other far superior films . \\ngregg araki obviously has seen such films as \" easy rider , \" \" natural born killers , \" and \" kalifornia , \" and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like a pop culture reference guide . \\nbut what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not , or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them to make them deeper . \\n \" the doom generation \" doesn\\'t want to do this ; it just wants to show everything in a surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level . \\nhe wants to show everything in a weird manner , and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about . \\nhere\\'s one scene , an earlier scene in the film : amy and jordan go into a quick-e mart type place to get food and other stuff . \\namy is smoking , and the clerk , an asian man mind you ( i love how racist this film is , i really do ) , tells her to put it out . \\nshe tells him to fuck off or something to that note . \\nhe points a shotgun at her , and she puts it out reluctantly . \\njordan makes two hot dogs , and takes them to the counter . \\nthe cash register rings up \" 6 . 66 \" \\n ( oh , and this symbolism doesn\\'t stop here ) . \\njordan checks for his wallet but it\\'s really in the car . \\nhe asks amy for it , but she left her wallet in the car as well . \\nthe clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money . \\nthey say they don\\'t have it . \\nhe gets ready to kill them , but then xavier , who they ditched in the middle of nowhere a scene before , pops out of nowhere , fights with the clerk , and ends with him blowing the clerk\\'s head clean off ( clean wound , mind you ) . \\nthe head is shown flying through the air , and lands in a fryer , where it begins to scream . \\ni don\\'t really object to this kind of sick violence , but this scene is in the film for one reason and one reason only : to gross you out . \\naraki thinks that if he takes everything to the extreme , he\\'ll make some kind of art . \\nwrong . \\nit takes a kind of resistance to make gore art . \\nwhen george romero made \" dawn of the dead , \" a very gory flick even for today , he had control over everything and still was able to make everything sick . \\nsame goes for peter jackson\\'s disgustingly gory \" dead alive , \" which features a 30 minute long fest of blood , guts , dismemberments , flesh chewing , and other assorted stuff , all ending with a guy with a lawn mower strapped to his body , taking out all sorts of zombies . \\nit was sick , but it was also satirical , and controled . \\na scene like this has no purpose in the film , and it sticks out from everything else that happens . \\nhere\\'s a couple other scenes : jordan and amy have sex in a bath tub and xavier watches , masturbates , and then licks the semen from his hand ; xavier and amy have sex and jordan watches from the window , masturbates , and falls backwards ; a man attacks the trio , and is stabbed in the crotch by a giant sword ( put there just so this could happen ) ; a fast food employee stalks the trio , and his arm is shot off by xavier ; and various other annoyances . \\nalso , look for about a million camoes from a wide assortment of people , who probably didn\\'t really know what they were getting into when they signed up to do it ( just like peter o\\'toole , helen mirren , malcolm macdowell , and john gielgud probably didn\\'t when they signed to be in \" caligula \" ) . \\npeople such as indie actors parker posey and nicky katt , alternative rock stars skinny puppy and perry farrel , hollywood madam heidi fleiss , christopher \" peter brady \" mcknight , amanda bearse , and margaret cho all grace the screen for a matter of seconds , then disappear so that we can return to the annoying main plot line . \\nwhy are they here ? \\nso that we can all point to them and say \" hey , look it\\'s ( fill in the blank ) ! \\nwow ! \" \\ngimme a break . \\nthe film\\'s meaning is pretty easy to detect : that , you know , teens are so precious , and the world is such a horrible place , that when the two entities collide , there\\'s a giant explosion of horrific violence . \\notherwise defined as \" teen angst , \" or the belief that being a teenager is a horrible thing and that the world is too bad for you . \\nlook , i\\'m 19 years old . \\ni went through a very brief teen angst thing which curiously lasted about as long as my taste in nirvana did . \\ni\\'ve since moved on to \" i don\\'t really know what to do with my life \" phase , but the teen angst phase is something which is so annoyingly sophomoric and ignorant that any film that thinks they\\'re dealing with it on any kind of serious level is just beating the wrong horse . \\npart of being a teen is experimenting , and testing the waters . \\nit\\'s not whining about how awful parents are , and purposely feeling dispondent . \\nthis is what the characters in this film do , and the film wants to show how they\\'re these great people who are being punished by the world because they\\'re teenagers , and how they try to defend themselves but can\\'t totally overcome them . \\nit\\'s not their fault they kill people ; it\\'s the world\\'s ! \\nwhat they really need is a reality check . \\nthe world is a bad place , and teenagers can be easily harmed because they are experimenting . \\nbut part of it is taking everything that happens to you and learning from it . \\nthe film thinks that teenagers are basically doomed , and there\\'s nothing they can do about it . \\nhence the title . \\nnot only does it have bad fallacy , but it can\\'t even express this in an intelligent and coherent manner . \\neverything\\'s overly surreal , and all we get are scenes of graphic violence and graphic sex . \\nhow does xavier licking semen off his hand express teen angst ? \\nhow does a talking decapitated head show that teens are dispondent because the world makes them this way ? \\nand why does the film constantly go back to the teen angst issue of the film ? \\nif araki had any kind of competence in writing or direction , he\\'d show them for what they really are . \\nand if he didn\\'t want the satirical approach , he\\'d show the real problems with the world . \\nand if you still don\\'t think that \" the doom generation \" is incompetent on every single possible level it could be , take the acting . \\nrose macgowan is horrible . \\nyes , she proved herself talented in \" scream , \" but she\\'s so bad in \" the doom generation \" that if i had not seen her in \" scream , \" i would have christened her one of the worst actresses working in films today . \\nher entire performance is one-note ( bitchy ) , and the one scene where she cries over a dead animal is so forced that it\\'s laughable . \\nequally bad is jonathan schaech , who wants to be the slacker serial killer : someone who doesn\\'t have any remorse because emotions cause some kind of strain . \\nhis performance is annoying as hell , and granted , he was better in \" that thing you do ! \" \\nand then there\\'s james duval . \\nlet\\'s just say he makes keanu reeves look like brando . \\nhe has the same kind of slacker stuttering , only much much much worse , and every line he says is so bad that i have now deemed him \" least talented actor in the world . \" \\ni have seen lots of bad actors , but james duval has got to be the worst . \\nor at least somewhere up there . \\nhere\\'s another example of a bad scene , if you\\'re still not convinced : the film opens up in a club where they\\'re playing nine inch nail\\'s most banal song , \" heresy \" ( example of the lines : \" god is dead/and no one cares/if there is a hell/i\\'ll see you there \" ) , and as the song plays , and red strobe lights show the patrons dancing , the film pans over to amy , just standing there , looking dispondent . \\nthe film closes in on her , she looks right at the camera and says \" fuck . \" \\nno explanation of this should be necessary . \\nand finally , a note to gregg : grow up . \\nreally . \\nmove out of your parent\\'s basement , read something other than salinger , and get a day job . \\nand don\\'t quit it . \\n',\n",

              " 'at first glance , i thought that the sword and the sorceror had promise . \\nits plotline goes like this : the evil king cromwell , desiring to take over the world , resurrects an evil , ancient sorceror , xusia for power . \\nhe attacks the kingdom of eh-dan and kills young prince talon\\'s parents . \\ngiven a triple-bladed sword ( which can shoot bad guys , like a gun ) by his dying father , talon vows for revenge . \\neleven years later , when he\\'s established his own army , the mercaneries , he vows to take back his kingdom . \\nalong the way , he meets up with alana , whose village is attacked by drunken guards and her brother is kidnapped by cromwell . \\ntalon vows to help , and , after a series of minor escapades , eventually ends up rescuing alana\\'s brother ( and several other prisoners ) , only to be captured himself ( in other words , put on a cross to be crucified ! ) . \\nfortunately he frees himself , rescues alana from marrying cromwell , defeats xusia , and then cromwell , all with his triple bladed sword ( during the final battle , the blade breaks , but talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger in the blade ) . \\nthen , everything ends happily . \\nunfortunately , the sword and the sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds . \\nwhat would have been a great film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping , bad acting , and gruesomely gory , bloody scenes . \\nnever once does the story seem to connect together , it just jumps around repeatedly . \\nthis problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia . \\nafter telling him that he needs his help , he leads the warlock out into daylight , but then stabs him and sends him careening off a cliff afterwards . \\nwait a minute , didn\\'t the plotline say that he needs the help of xusia in order to invade eh-dan , which he cannot do by military force ? \\nif that is the case , why does he dispose of xusia after resurrecting him ? \\nand why does he manage to take over eh-dan anyway ? \\nthese questions are just never - no , never - answered in the film . \\nanother example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life , another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alana\\'s wedding to cromwell ( ! ) , and finally at the end , instead of settling down with alana , he just tells her to \" wait \" , and then he just rides off ! \\nin addition to the extremely bloody scenes , this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what would have been a great fantasy adventure . \\neven some attempts to make it exciting , a few fire scenes , battle scenes , don\\'t work . \\nit just completely fails altogether miserably . \\nthe only good thing about this film is its musical score , contributed by david whittaker , who had an ( extremely ) short music composing career . \\nthe score is boomy and adventurous , powerful , and a billion times better than this film is . \\nmy suggestion : steer the hell away from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead ( if you can find it ) . \\nironically , though , before the film\\'s credits roll , there is a message indicating that a sequel , tales of the ancient empire , would follow . \\nto my relief ( and delight ) , it never got into production , because the sword and the sorcerer laid an egg at the box office , grossing only $39 million . \\ncritics were right on in slamming the sword and the sorcerer , all right . \\nleonard maltin rightfully called it \" second rate in scripting , and acting \" and at-a-glance film reviews called it \" a confusing , stupid , unimaginative , unengaging , bloodfilled bore \" . \\ni totally agree with these reviews , all right , and i hope that this piece of #$% ! \\nwill be forgotten about . \\nthere are far better fantasy movies than the sword and the sorcerer . \\ni hope you get a good laugh out of this review , but i am not laughing . \\nin fact , my insults don\\'t even come close to the gruesome sickness that this film gave me throughout its 100 minute running time . \\n',\n",

character in a film of imperfections . \\nhe is nether sexually deprived , nor uncertain about his future , as he is in law school . \\nhis lack of flaws is both boring , unrealistic and painful to watch . \\nas bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub-standard comedy . \\nmoving on , there is val ( christina ricci ) and stephie , ( gabby hoffman ) 2 teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts . \\nval is monica's cousin and a true fan of the new york scene . \\non the other hand , stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just can't find . \\nparadoxically , it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar ( actually they attempt to flee from their presence , but aren't successful ) who guide them through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds . \\nof all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples , only one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot . \\nwisely , the movie's creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy ( courtney love ) and kevin ( paul rudd ) who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless . \\npaul has just broken up with long time steady ellie ( janeane garofalo ) and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship . \\nhowever , the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends , and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening . \\nfinally , there are the two worst performances and worst sub-plot of the film . \\njack ( jay mohr ) and cindy ( kate hudson ) have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindy's virginity the night before . \\nwhile she attempts to play this down and be her usual self , he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy . \\nvery often , when a film is as putrid as this production , there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory . \\nhowever , this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted . \\ninstead , what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts , bad continuity and inaccuracies . \\nfirst , and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another , there is no apparent order that it follows , and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot . \\nat other times , objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot . \\nthere are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish . \\nnot in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver . \\nand yet , no matter how miserable this film may be , and no matter how poor the acting is all around , there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots . \\nperhaps , if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or , perhaps , even three , there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development , or quality acting , or even a decent plot payoff at the end . \\nbut it didn't happen that way . \\nthe cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance , and

\\nas in the original film , \" toy story 2 \" contains first-rate animation , and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there . \\nreportedly , the film was originally slated for a direct-to-video release , but after seeing the improvements that had been made , disney rightly decided to release it into theaters . \\nthe film is well worth seeing on the big screen . \\nthe colors are bright , the textures sharp , and even the human characters look more \" human . \" \\nthe animation is consistently seamless , with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable . \\nthere are so many impressive sequences that i\\'d find it impossible to list them here , but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al\\' s toy barn , the store owned by woody\\'s captor . \\npixar\\'s rendition of the family dog is also nicely done , with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it . \\nthe voice work is also perfectly complementary , and as with the first movie , does much to help further character development . \\ntom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz , making you forget who is doing the voice . \\nit was woody and buzz up there , not tom and tim . \\nall the cast members from the original reprise their roles , and each is excellent . \\nseveral new voices have been added , with joan cusack , kelsey grammer , and wayne knight doing fine work . \\n \" toy story 2 \" is strong in characterization , and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie . \\nwoody faces difficult choices , while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn\\'t yet realized his status as a toy , forcing him to see what he used to be like . \\nthe new characters are also developed quite well , especially jesse , who narrates a sarah mclachlan-aided flashback illustrating how she was loved , then forgotten by her owner . \\nit may be computer-animated , and it may have sappy music , but it\\'s downright touching . \\nthe script , despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers , is endlessly clever and inventive , especially considering that it\\'s a sequel . \\nthe reason \" toy story 2 \" works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original\\'s success by re-doing the same story and using the same characters . \\nnot this one . \\nwe get character change , new characters , and new issues brought up . \\n \" toy story 2 \" is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself . \\nthere is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here . \\nthe humor is sharp and witty , with something to amuse both kids and adults . \\nthere are funny asides to films such as \" star wars \" and \" jurassic park , \" among others , new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock \\'em sock \\'em robots , and appearances from other pixar efforts \" a bug\\'s life \" and the 1997 short \" geri \\'s game . \" \\n ( geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woody\\'s broken arm . ) \\nthe action is fast and furious , and the chases ( in the street , in a toy store , in an elevator , on a baggage carousel , and in an airplane ) keep getting bigger and better . \\n \" toy story 2 \" never grows stagnant , because there is always something new to hold your interest . \\nthe more you pay attention to it , the more rewarding it is . \\nit\\'s rare to see a film like \" toy story 2 \" come along , because it\\'s the kind of film that\\'s almost impossible to dislike . \\nit\\'s created purely to entertain , and though i enjoy a thought-provoking drama as much as the next person , it\\'s nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do : send us out with a smile . \\nit\\'s a fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing \" toy story 2 . \" it\\'s the rare sequel that manages to expand on , and live up to , the original . \\n',\n",

enigma . \\nthere is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance . \\njake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk . \\ndespite the inevitable faults , there is so much to enjoy about the movie . \\nthe heightened excitement of the final sequences doesn\\'t quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes , but they are amazing and edge-of-your-seat fun in their own rite . \\nthe film is a treasure to look at . \\nthe visual effects are astonishing 99 . 8% of the time- the awe-inspiring , mouth-opening , eye-popping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius . \\nnot since 1997\\'s the fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one . \\nthe production design is reminiscent of the fifth element , the previous star wars movies , kubrick\\'s 2001 , maybe even of fritz lang\\'s classic silent metropolis . \\nhowever , all the sets are so original . \\nthe original star wars movies can\\'t even match the grandeur of this film\\'s visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer- it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode . \\nthe costumes are remarkable and have jean-paul gaultier written all over them . \\nwhether its queen amadala\\'s gigantic wardrobe complete with gold-embroidery and feathers , or the jedis\\' simple brown uniforms , the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness . \\nthe costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie . \\nas for john williams\\' score , i don\\'t think he\\'s done one as complex or powerful since ?

\\nmi2 begins flashily enough , that initial flash leading us to believe that it\\'ll soon give way to something of a plot , but it only gives way to more flash , then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise\\'s firing gun just so they can die really cool . \\nearly on , during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) and nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) , woo works some of his trademark magic . \\nin one hypnotic , though completely inexplicable sequence , the director slows the action down to a languid semi-stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other\\'s eyes with come hither sexuality ?

\\ni haven\\'t the foggiest . \\ni doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply . \\nwith mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine , the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects . \\nit\\'s possible that these \" spies \" could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off , though of course this is never explored . \\nthe scenes i\\'ve described are really only included to titillate , not to give any insight into character . \\ngod forbid . \\nwoo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic , but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial-like visuals . \\nstill in terms of crackerjack eye candy , the opening has much to cherish . \\ncruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices ( the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is ) . \\nbetween the frantic dancing , woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact . \\nthe scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way , yet it has style and something of soul , and woo casts a bit of a spell on us . \\nsure it\\'s all smoke and mirrors , but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product . \\nthandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that\\'s about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez \\\\ george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight . \\nthey flirt and exchange obvious double entendres . \\nnewton bats her eyes flirtatiously . \\ncruise grins a little too slyly . \\nthe cruise character , ethan hunt , has been drastically altered since the first film . \\nhere cruise plays him more as a hip , sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1 . \\nhe\\'s cool and dashing , which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut ( which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film ) , and blustered his way through magnolia ( quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90\\'s ) . \\nsadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise\\'s initial \" i\\'m the man ! \" \\ncharm and more slo-mo close-ups of his preening mug . \\nmi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act , which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won\\'t stop . \\nthe whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle ( the first gun fight in the film ) , which really should be unheard of in a john woo film , but alas this particular battle could\\'ve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi ( of course excepting the \" symbolic \" pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture ) . \\nwe\\'ve all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand . \\nit isn\\'t done any differently here . \\nthe action is pure hard target \\\\ broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind . \\nhe\\'s cool for sure but he\\'s made to be as empty as the movie . \\nthe actor isn\\'t used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks ; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment , be it during a gunfight , before one or after one . \\nwhen he\\'s not beaming away , he\\'s staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell , but woo\\'s editing seriously undermines the effort . \\nhe fetishizes cruise\\'s angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof . \\ni half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he\\'s really austin powers . \\nin a classic woo action moment , ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin-up boy angel of death . \\nthe gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual ( one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise , basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does ) . \\nthe lead bad guy ( played by the appropriately british dougray scott ) and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken ?

he also penned the wonderful sleeper , mystic pizza . \\nthe film , like the play , is set in atlanta , georgia , and it revolves around two people in their twilight years : a cranky , 70-something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a 60-something black man who becomes her chauffeur . \\nthe movie relies on character , rather than plot , to propel the action . \\nin fact , the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense ; it doesn\\'t present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together . \\nrather , driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life : shopping , listening to the radio , visiting the cemetery , eating fried chicken , and so on . \\nthe film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta\\'s history , including the 1958 bombing of the temple ( the city\\'s oldest jewish congregation ) and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr . martin luther king , jr . \\nthe story begins in 1948 with daisy ( tandy ) crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway . \\nthe insurance company cancels her insurance , and her son , boolie , decides to hire her a chauffeur . \\nfreeman , reprising his role from the play , plays the chauffeur , hoke . \\nthe film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger . \\ndriving miss daisy is a movie about human nature , aging , prejudice , and a great many other things , but more than anything it\\'s about a relationship : one that spans 25 years , 4 cars , the advent of civil rights , and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon . \\ndaisy is strong-willed and set in her ways , and , from the outset , she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur . \\ninitially , she treats hoke with contempt , refusing to let him drive her anywhere . \\nonce she does get in the car , daisy is the ultimate back-seat driver . \\nto make matters worse , she is extremely self-conscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand . \\neventually , however , daisy is worn down by hoke\\'s good-natured charm and infectious cheer ;

unfunny , alienating , and a big fat bore , at least to anyone over the age of 11 and above the iq of 10 . \\nthis one , however , is shockingly not bad . \\nin fact , it\\'s actually good . \\nnot the original good , but what\\'s great about it is that it doesn\\'t necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining . \\nbecause it\\'s cute and innocent fun . \\nbecause it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with . \\nbecause the lead star is immensely appealing . \\nbecause the parents are also immensely appealing . \\nand ( i\\'m repeating myself ) because it\\'s cute and innocent fun . \\nthere\\'s nothing too risque about it , save the plot ( the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish , but that is precisely the point of the movie ) , and it\\'s aimed directly at either kids , adults who want to remember the original , or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a kid . \\ni , personally , am somewhere between the second and third . \\ni can vividly remember when my taste in movies wasn\\'t so weird or diverse ( the names godard and kubrick weren\\'t even a glimmer in my right eye back then ) , when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple years to see abc\\'s \" wonderful world of disney , \" where they\\'d show you a live-action and/or made-for-tv disney flick an hour per week . \\ni can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films ( like \" lady and the tramp \" and \" pinnochio \" ) . \\nand , most sadly , i remember every single christmas , without fail , there were a barage of children\\'s animated half-hour shows , made exclusively for the christmas season , that i wouldn\\'t dare missing . \\ni can even remember seeing the made-for-tv \" parent trap ii \" on tv one night , and after i had seen that one over and over and over again , i saw the original \" parent trap . \" \\nit\\'s more of a late childhood movie , because it deals with the issue of divorce , but it deals with it in a disney-ized version . \\nit\\'s playful , and witty , and charming , and if i saw it for the first time right now , having never experienced that part of my childhood , i\\'d probably dismiss it . \\ni\\'d probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadn\\'t seen the original at such a perfect age . \\nwatching it , i could remember what fun it was to watch a disney film , and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my seemingly-perfect parents splitting up , and how it affected my adolescence . \\nand also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke , and pointed out that even in the most fucked-up of situations , things could always work out if you , well , manipulate things a bit , at least for the better . \\nthis new version did that for me , but it\\'s also charming in its own way . \\nit has a new cast , a contemporary feel , and , for the first time in awhile for a live-action-disney flick , a tone that isn\\'t corny or condescending , but just right . \\nthe moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way . \\nand for the first time since the original film , the kids actually know better than the foolish adults . \\nthe story is basically classic by now , repeated almost as many times as kurosawa\\'s \" the seven samurai \" : a pair of twins ( played here by lindsay lohan , just like they were played by hayley mills in the original ) are separated at birth by their divorcing parents . \\none , annie , is sent to live with the mother ( natasha richardson , resembling her mother , vanessa redgrave , more than i had ever noticed ) in london , where she lives with her parents and her devoted , foppish butler ( simon kunz ) , as she works as a swingin\\' fashion designer . \\nshe grows up refined and classy , but also with a keen knowledge in sports and poker-playing . \\nthe other , hallie , is sent to northern california with her father ( dennis quaid ) to live on a vineyard with their pseudo-maid ( lisa ann walter ) , and grows up rugged yet charming . \\nthey both meet at the same camp , one that annie wants to go to to become more rugged . \\nthey feud because they look all-too similar , and are thus in tight competition , which results in some nasty pranks , which winds them in seclusion together in a private , out-of-the-way cabin . \\nthere , they become friends , then learn about eachother . \\nonce they know everything , they concoct a scheme to switch places so the one can meet the other parent , whom they\\'ve only heard of . \\nthey learn about eachother\\'s lives in detail , they make sure they look alike ( which requires hair cutting and , notoriously , ear-piercing - a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in \" pulp fiction \" ) , and when the end of summer comes , they switch and hope for the best . \\nlindsay lohan doesn\\'t necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mills in the original . \\nbut she comes off just as appealing as she did once . \\nshe does , though , add a couple new things : she makes the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original , respectively . \\nshe also adds on an american and british accent to each one , with one faking the other accent throughout , and if you really take notice , you can see that the fake ones\\' accents aren\\'t exactly perfect . \\nshe\\'s also incredibly appealing , not merely cute , which is especially notable since this is her first feature film , and we know how notorious child actors are , especially in their first films . \\nshe makes a great protagonist , and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing . \\ndennis quaid , in fact , hasn\\'t been this likable in about a decade - his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what has made him a notable actor in the past , not just that he\\'s mr . meg ryan . \\nditto natasha richardson ( except that she just hasn\\'t ever been this likable period ) . \\nthe two make a winning couple , maybe not so winning as maureen o\\'hara and the late brian keith in the original , but they still work for this film . \\ninstead of the bickering that ensued in the original , the film adds another dimension and another angle to their characters that was amiss in the original : during the opening credits , we see glimpses from their courtship on the qe2 , where they fall quickly and madly in love with eachother , and when back together again , the film\\'s more smarmy scenes come off as actually sentimental , but in that great way , not the migraine-inducing way as in many such films . \\nthis all brings this new \" parent trap \" to a level of entertainment that hasn\\'t really existed since , well , the original film years ago , still my money the best live-action-disney flick of all time . \\nthis is because it has a form of intelligence and wit that makes such plot points as an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot ( a gold-digging sharon stone type , played by elaine hendrix , who\\'s deliciously tormented by the twins later on in the film ) a treat instead of a bore . \\nlike the original , this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be ( case in point : \" it takes two \" starring the olsen twins ) because it treats the children as the smart ones , and the adults as the silly ones , not the other way around . \\nand because , above everything , it knows exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew . \\nhowever , in comparison with the original , it could be a bit better . \\ncertain scenes work well , but not nearly as well as they worked in the original . \\ni liked the way the parents fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling in love again better than i liked watching two old flames getting back together over a bottle of wine - somehow , feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing , a lesson extracted from the howard hawks/cary grant films of yesteryear . \\nand as much as this film transcends mere cutedom , compared to the original , this film almost drowns in cutedom . \\nthe original , though not gritty , was far more stylized and just as suitable for adult audiences as it was for young audiences . \\nas such , this remake may never be nearly as great or classic as the original film , but it at least knows how to treat its source material with dignity and respect , and how to create virtually the same effects without bordering on plagerism or petty annoyances . \\n',\n",
              " '14 years ago , national lampoon introduced us to a new family - the griswolds . \\nin 1983 , the griswolds embarked on a cross-country journey with the destination of wally world , a world-renowned theme park in california . \\nwe laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured . \\ntwo years later , we watched again as they went to europe , and four years after that , we shared christmas with them . \\nnow , eight more years have passed , and the laughs have done more than die . \\nthey\\'ve been cremated . \\nvegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold , the good intentioned but ill-fated father of two . \\nthe premise is basically the same . \\nclark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation , this time to las vegas . \\nhis wife ellen ( beverly d\\'angelo ) and teenage kids rusty and audrey ( always played by different actors - this time around , by ethan embry and marisol nichols , respectively ) join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick . \\nof course a \" vacation \" movie wouldn\\'t be complete without good ole eddie ( reprised by randy quaid ) , the misfit cousin , showing up at all the wrong times . \\nthere isn\\'t too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it . \\nit\\'s really just a skit movie . \\nthere are a couple of ways to define a skit movie , which is not a real term as far as i know . \\nthe first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours , therefore coming off like a two hour skit . \\nthe second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits , each lasting about five minutes . \\nvegas vacation comes off like the first . \\na good example of the latter would be last year\\'s black sheep . \\nthe problem with this format is that it becomes old fast , and it doesn\\'t really fit into a movie mold . \\nin these cases , a \" plot \" , which is generally very thin , is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags ( i . e . \\nhave a good vegas joke , make a vegas movie ) . \\nsuch is the case with this movie\\'s mini-plots . \\nclark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswold\\'s money , ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton ( ! ) , rusty has a fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage , and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie ( shae d\\'lyn ) as an exotic dancer . \\nthe simple fact is : this movie isn\\'t funny . \\nat first , i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes , but when the movie got rolling , my interest suddenly stopped . \\nchase plays clark griswold really well . \\nhe made the character and he is the character . \\nd\\'angelo , to be quite honest , never was too impressive as ellen , and this movie doesn\\'t show any signs of redemption . \\nas for the two new griswold kids , the word \" blah \" comes to mind . \\nthe \" vacation \" series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters , the simple reason being that there is nothing to them . \\nthey\\'re so generic , you\\'ll expect the credits to read \" girl #1 as audrey griswold \" . \\nvegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor . \\nyes , it\\'s true that vegas vacation isn\\'t even close to being close to being as funny as the others , which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways , but there are a couple of other things that set this one negatively apart . \\nfirst off , why did they leave off the national lampoon\\'s heading on the title ? \\ni couldn\\'t find any reasons why , but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn\\'t want to be associated with such a lame film . \\nthat\\'s saying a lot , especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented : loaded weapon 1 , pcu , etc . if they expected this to be another hit , you would assume they\\'d be proud to tack on the notorious header , but for reasons only we can guess at , like the movie sucking , they didn\\'t . \\nthere is another difference here that makes an obvious impact . \\nthe first three films in the \" vacation \" series were written by john hughes , a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the 80\\'s including mr . \\nmom , sixteen candles , the breakfast club , weird science , pretty in pink , ferris bueller\\'s day off , planes , trains , and automobiles , and uncle buck . \\nwowzers ! \\nwhat a r ? sum ? ! \\nlooking at the names , you\\'d think this guy wrote everything that now stands as a movie icon for the 1980\\'s . \\nwell that\\'s not all . \\nthis guy also brought us 90\\'s hits including the home alone series , the remake of 101 dalmatians , dennis the menace , and the current flubber . \\nvegas vacation , however , didn\\'t have john hughes behind it , and the loss is very obvious . \\nthis time around , the script is in the hands of elisa bell , whose only credits thus far include four made-for-tv movies . \\nvegas vacation plays very much like one , and it would actually work much better as a made-for-tv sequel . \\nif this sounds like a wild idea , it\\'s not . \\nrevenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies , and they seemed like it . \\nvegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as a 2 : 00 a . m . \\nsunday morning movie , but as a silver screen major motion picture , it\\'s quite out of place . \\nstephen kessler\\'s jejune direction doesn\\'t help things either . \\nhe only makes the film even more tv-movie-ish . \\neach consecutive \" vacation \" movie has suffered a drop in directing power . \\nwe started the series off with harold ramis , who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as co-writing ghostbusters . \\nnot too bad . \\nthen we had national lampoon\\'s european vacation being directed by amy heckerling , who would go on to direct the hits look who\\'s talking and clueless , as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high . \\nlastly we had national lampoon\\'s christmas vacation , directed by jeremiah s . chechik , who went on to direct the charming benny & joon . \\nkessler , so far , has one title under his belt , the short film birch street gym , which received an oscar nomination in 1992 . \\ngranted that this was his first attempt at a feature length film , we can allow for some amateurish quality , but instead we get a movie straight from the text book - boring , bland , and deeply unoriginal . \\nif you loved the \" vacation \" movies , and i know * some * of us did , there still isn\\'t anything here worth seeing . \\nif you loved them , don\\'t ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala carte . \\nif you never did like the series , why the need to confirm why ?

a tear rolls down washington\\'s cheek--and will probably run down your cheek as well . \\nthe episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn\\'t deserting the army at all ; he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores . \\nfreeman is , as usual , a strong presence , even in a small supporting role . \\nhe plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember . \\nhe quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers , holding the group together and serving as a liaison to the white officers . \\ncolonel shaw recognizes freeman\\'s leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major , making him the first black officer in the army . \\nandre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles , a free black who is one of shaw\\'s close childhood friends . \\nsearles is educated and refined , like a white man , prompting washington to nickname him \" snow flake . \" \\nthe burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat . \\nthe road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment . \\nthe soldiers suffer innumerable hardships , but somehow they never lose their morale . \\nthe army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens , subjecting them to racism and discrimination . \\nthey are paid only $10 a month , whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen , and , for a long time , they have to go without shoes , guns , or uniforms . \\nto make matters worse , the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks into action , preferring instead to use them for manual labor . \\neventually , however , the regiment receives its boots , uniforms , rifles , and right to fight , thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw . \\nshaw has absolute faith in his soldiers , and he fights tooth and nail to get them what they deserve , even if it means threatening a general with blackmail . \\nbroderick , in fact , is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment . \\nunfortunately , however , broderick\\'s uneven performance is , in many respects , the weak link in the movie . \\nin an effort to look more mature , broderick sports a mustache and a goatee , and throughout the film he slips in and out of a phony boston accent . \\nhe is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced . \\nthe film places too much weight on broderick\\'s character and not enough on the black soldiers , who are more intriguing . \\nglory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war . \\nthe movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july . \\nglory does not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts . \\nexcept for a few bullet wounds and one exploding head , the film , for the most part , leaves the gore to your imagination , which is not to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid . \\nto the contrary , they are chaotic and horrifying ; it\\'s just that director edward zwick ( the co-creator of \" thirtysomething \" ) films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster . \\nthe key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers . \\nthe movie depicts some of ( but not enough of ) their customs and rituals . \\nin one scene , for example , the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers around the campfire . \\neach man has a chance to relay a few words of inspiration . \\na couple of the movie\\'s most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe , disbelief and pride . \\nthe regiment\\'s greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle , thereby earning the respect of their white peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner . \\nlike any war film , glory has its share of gloom and despair , but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson , a valuable reminder that despite what the history books say ( or , more precisely , what they do not say ) , blacks played a critically important role in the north\\'s victory over the south--forever changing the evolution of america . \\n',\n",

and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as jude\\'s wife , whom he never divorces . \\n \" jude \" moves at a very slow pace , and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists , which would drive some people nuts . \\nbut those who appreciate good social commentary with their films , no matter how slow or downright depressing they are ( this one is both ) will appreciate \" jude , \" though i doubt anyone truly enjoys it . \\n',\n",

\\nlet me first say that religions of this nature , in the ideal , take the place of sex . \\nconsider the catholic church , which in its hey-dey , took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever . \\ngod takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope , cardinals , bishops , monks , etc . they forego the one , in order to come closer to the other . \\nduring the middle ages , when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged , the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power . \\n ( parenthetically , witness plato as well . \\nin the republic , he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime . \\nnot coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself , regularly assailing the passions . ) \\ncatholicism , as policy , attacks the passions as evil . \\nit sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure . \\nmasturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution . \\nthis is religion , this is authoritarianism in its essence . \\nas further evidence , the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters . \\nour culture , most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years . \\nwe can\\'t help but adopt , even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes , leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self . \\nmickey and mallory knox internalized them , too , then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other , discovered them , and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves . \\nit is a straightforward liberation through sex . \\nas some good patriarch once observed , \" you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on . \" \\nm&m had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions . \\nthey saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions . \\n \" the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers , \" as mickey says . \\nas a the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter : let us look each other in the face . \\nwe are hyberboreans--we know well enough how remote our place is . \\n \" neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans \" : even pindar , in his day , knew that much about us . \\nbeyond the north , beyond ice , beyond death--our life , our happiness . . . . \\nwe have discovered that happiness ; we know the way ; we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth . \\nwho else has found it ? --the \\nman of today ? -- \" i \\ndon\\'t know either the way out or the way in ; i am whatever doesn\\'t know either the way out or the way in \" --so sighs the man of today . . . . \\nthis is the sort of modernity that made us ill--we sickened in lazy peace , cowardly compromise , the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay . \\nthis tolerance and largeur of the heart that \" forgives \" everything because it \" understands \" everything is a sirocco to us . \\nrather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south-winds ! \\nas far as i can tell , this is what the movie has to say . \\nits alleged critique of the media is only secondary , tertiary , quaternary , subsidiary for sure . \\nfor example wayne gayle\\'s first report ends with some gen x dude saying , \" if i were a mass murderer i\\'d be mickey and mallory , \" in his most excellent bill and ted voice . \\non one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical , impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes . \\nit seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what m&m were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself he\\'d be just like them , killing and destroying what deserves it . \\nlet me exemplify what i\\'ve been saying by analyzing a scene from the film , namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant , kills him , and then castigates him for giving her \" the worst fuckin\\' head i\\'ve ever had in my life ! ! ! \" \\nnow , i never claimed that mickey and mallory had a perfect relationship , because demonstrably they didn\\'t , and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this . \\nsometimes they are the source of each others frustrations , but unwilling to kill each other , since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation , they must kill in place of their lever . \\nit\\'s no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey . \\nas the attendant approached he took on mickey\\'s character in the eyes of mallory . \\nshe needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory . \\nupon discovery , mallory views this as a betrayal , judges him , and commutes his sentence on someone else . \\nthe style of the movie is a whole \\'nother matter that i won\\'t get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power . \\nlet me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness , barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle . \\nthe rapid succession of all those 8mm , 16mm , 35mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish , frenetic mood . \\nalso , jungian archetypes abound . \\nthese can\\'t help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames . \\nsome of the best scenes and lines that come to mind . ( quotes are paraphrased only ) : \\nmickey to mallory : \" one of these days i\\'m gonna be cummin\\' for you , \" in prison , while mallory jacks mickey off . \\nsemen is a symbol for great potential and things to come . \\nat the time they haven\\'t yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet . \\nthe two of course go hand in hand . \\nfor an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs . \\nmickey during his marriage to mallory : \" as creator of my universe , i pronounce us man and wife . \" \\nthe way woody delivers this line is truly haunting , but telling , too . \\nit reveals m&m are well on their way to expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them with positive ones . \\nthis is what mickey means by \" creator of my universe , \" he is giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes . \\nit is not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears . \\nscagnetti\\'s first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from the gas station attendant\\'s mouth . \\nthe indian sage releasing mallory\\'s father , who was reincarnated as a snake : \" old man , go be a snake , \" after telling his \" snake story \" that ends with \" bitch , you knew i was a snake . \" \\nafter mickey shoots this sage to death during a bewildering nightmare , mallory says , \" you killed life ! ! ! \" \\nthis is another telling quote because it implies they didn\\'t see themselves as killers of life . \\nthen what were they killing up to that time ? \\nin some case just those zombies faking their way through life , the living dead , as it were . \\nin other cases , all the anti-life forces , the cops and their parents . \\nthe butterfly just before the movie shifts into the prison . \\nit of course symbolizes rebirth . \\ndr . emil reingold , as portrayed by steven wright , passing judgement on m&m : \" mickey and mallory know the difference between right and wrong , they just don\\'t give a damn . \" \\nthis is reminiscent of nietzsche\\'s whole philosophy , and maybe a direct reference to his beyond good and evil . \\nmickey : \" the rabbit says the moment of realization is worth 1000 prayers . \" \\nmickey ( again in his interview ) : \" me and you , we are not the same species . \" \\nnotice when the escape is in progress we get some role reversals in terms of leadership and control . \\nmickey the prisoner becomes the leader of his little gang . \\nthe wardens become prisoners and the civilians like wayne gayle and his producer follow the leader , no matter who it is . \\nmickey : how ya feelin\\' ? \\nwayne : fucking great ! \\nmickey : you got the feelin\\' ? \\nwayne : i\\'m alive . \\ni\\'m alive for the first fuckin\\' time ! \\nwhat an incredible transformation this is . \\nhe got the feeling and he couldn\\'t contain himself . \\nwhat a feeling . \\nthat feeling of metaphysical freedom that you can create your own universe . \\nmickey when almost caught in a dead end , \" think , think , think , think . \" \\ngo figure it out . \\ndwight ( tommy lee jones ) in general , because he may be the sickest fuck in the whole film . \\nhis whole attitude can be summed up with , \" destroy them ! ! ! \" \\n',\n",

and mulder and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal building . \\nbut wait , i\\'m getting ahead of myself . \\nthe film actually opens in the ice age , about 32 , 000 years prior , during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien . \\nthe alien\\'s blood infects them ( fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer ) , and the story jumps into modern times , during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer . \\nit turns out that the bomb was planted to kill the boy , and mulder and scully uncover the cover-up despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi . \\nsoon , they find out that the whole thing has to do with aliens . \\nas i\\'ve written before , it\\'s not easy to write plot summaries for films like this , because everything needs to be a surprise . \\nfans of the show will know what to expect , and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film . \\ndirector rob bowman has done a great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen , making small adjustments and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television . \\nthere are some truly suspenseful and well-created scenes here ( late in the film , when they\\'re in the alien spacecraft , you\\'ll see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema ) . \\nthe special effects are very good , and the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic . \\nwhat i find interesting is that the x-files is actually a great way for series neophytes to get into the story . \\nour heroes are given subtle introductions ( we\\'re not expected to know them on the outset ) , and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isn\\'t required to understand the film . \\nthere are , of course , little elements that the makers have included as payoff to the fans , but i\\'ll keep those as surprises . \\nit takes a lot of thought and understanding of the series to create a film using roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides , and then create a coherent film that anyone can understand clearly . \\nthe series is strong for a lot of reasons . \\nit\\'s original ( though it has many ties to \" the twilight zone \" and owes some homage to hitchcock ) , and impressively eerie for a television show . \\nwhat really makes the series shine , however , are the actors . \\nduchovny has so much presence , and is just a fun guy to watch . \\nhe has that confidence that will someday make him into a bankable leading man . \\nanderson is equally good , and paralyzingly beautiful ; she\\'s also a strong actress . \\nboth performers have acted in little more than their series , however , though i think they\\'ll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon . \\ni enthusiastically recommend the x-files , both for fans and non-fans . \\n1998 is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters , and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry . \\nit\\'s an intelligent film , and takes you places that you might not have been ( or , at least , might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar ) . \\nthe x-files is impressive in concept , as well : fans of the series are likely to be highly critical , and to take the premise beyond the series is a risky move . \\nit\\'s nice to see a risk pay off for a change . \\nactually , it\\'s nice to see a risk at all . \\n',\n",

              " 'some critics , including siskel & ebert , are on the record stating that martin scorsese\\'s raging bull , the story of boxer jake la motta , is the best film of the \\'80s . \\nsince there are still a number of \\'80s films that i haven\\'t seen , i don\\'t feel qualified to make such a judgment , but i\\'ll say this without hesitation : raging bull is a great motion picture , and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january 1 , 1980 and december 31 , 1989 come close to its level . \\nbio-pics often fall into one of two categories : overblown hero- worship or a dry , dull textbook account . \\nit\\'s rare that a movie with the moniker \" based on the life of ? \" comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining . \\nraging bull is the perfect counterexample , and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre . \\nthe picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta , a middleweight icon from the \\'40s and \\'50s , and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen . \\nfor all 129 minutes , director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro ( in the title role ) have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic , sad , and horrifying . \\nhistorically , raging bull is said to be mostly accurately , with the lion\\'s share of the details culled from la motta\\'s own autobiography ( which was co-written with joseph carter and peter savage ) . \\nhowever , although la motta is credited as the movie\\'s \" consultant , \" he was reportedly unhappy with the final result , because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth , insensitive lout . \\nthe la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base , bestial impulses ? paranoia , jealousy , and blind rage . \\nsex and violence are inextricably linked . \\nthe title is apt ? la motta is a raging bull . \\nin the ring , he is a terror , not just beating his opponents , but destroying them . \\noutside of it , he is no less vicious or more easily controlled . \\nthe two people who spar with him on life\\'s canvas are his wife , vicki ( cathy moriarty ) , and his brother/manager , joey ( joe pesci ) . \\nthese are the two who mean the most to jake , and who , as a result of his inability to trust himself or others , he loses . \\nhe beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity , and , when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him , his lets loose with an explosion of violence . \\nraging bull opens in 1941 when la motta , an up-and-coming fighter , is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class . \\nover the years , he wins several key bouts , including one against his arch-rival , sugar ray robinson ( johnny barnes ) , but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match . \\nmeanwhile , away from the ring , la motta falls in love with 15-year old vicki , who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife . \\nvicki becomes jake\\'s greatest prize ( a wife , in his view , is not a companion , but a possession ) and the source of his most extreme pain . \\nhis own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him . \\nhence , he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else ? perhaps even his brother . \\n ( this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere : \" are you f * * king my wife ? ? ? \" ) \\nin the late \\'40s , la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight , but with one huge condition : he must take a fall . \\nhe does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing . \\ntwo years later , he wins the championship , only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray . \\nby the late \\'50s and early \\'60s , when the film ends , jake has become a pathetic figure ? a broke , overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor , has lost his wife and children , and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine . \\nraging bull is the other side of rocky . \\nsylvester stallone\\'s tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976 . \\nit won the 1977 best picture oscar , and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production . \\nbut , where rocky romanticizes boxing , raging bull takes a cold , unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring . \\nwhile scorsese\\'s primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man , he never backs away from showing the seedy , ugly underside of a sport where gambling , greed , and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working . \\nrocky shows boxing at its noblest ; raging bull shows it at its most diseased . \\nthere\\'s little i can say here that hasn\\'t already said about de niro\\'s performance . \\nin a career that has included many fine roles , this is his most outstanding . \\nthe level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering . \\nand , although there\\'s a lot of travis bickle ( de niro\\'s character in taxi driver ) in la motta , scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that , if we never fully sympathize with him , at least we understand the forces that drive him . \\nthis is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting . \\nas the younger jake , de niro is trim and fit . \\nas the fat , older man , de niro gained 50 pounds and turned his body into a grotesque parody of its normal form . \\nhow many actors would go that far ? \\nthe best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance . \\ncathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work ( although neither won ) . \\ntheir portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niro\\'s . \\npesci , who has basically re-created the same personality in two other scorsese films ( goodfellas and casino ) , presents joey as a slightly more intelligent version of his brother . \\nthe misogyny and violence are still there , only better concealed . \\nbut , when joey snaps , as he does in one scene where he pounds on a mobster ( frank vincent ) , it\\'s startling to behold . \\nmoriarty , on the other hand , must play the temptress with virginal qualities ? the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake . \\nlater , she\\'s called upon to portray the battered wife and mother whose love has turned into fear . \\nscorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in black-and-white ( a few \" home movie \" segments are in color ) . \\nthe choice is perfect for the movie , giving raging bull a unique look in an era when a black-and-white approach is almost unheard of . \\n ( one important recent exception , schindler\\'s list , eschewed color for some of the same reasons that raging bull did . ) \\nin black-and-white ( especially considering scorsese\\'s choice of shots and use of slow motion ) , the violence is stark and disturbing . \\nthere\\'s no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas . \\nduring fight sequences , the director also uses a number of point-of-view shots designed to show the world , however briefly , from la motta\\'s perspective . \\nscorsese could have chosen to end the film with la motta\\'s loss to sugar ray , where he surrendered his middleweight crown . \\nafter that , his career was all downhill . \\nyet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment , stretching more than a decade into la motta\\'s future . \\nthe reason is obvious : scorsese isn\\'t as interested in boxing as he is in the character . \\nfollowing his retirement , la motta is still as violent and volatile as ever , but he has lost the arena in which he can legally unleash those tendencies . \\nwe see the results of this beast let loose on society and how the consequences of his actions reduce him to a parody of his former self . \\nwho cannot feel a surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brando\\'s speech from on the waterfront ? \\n ( \" i coulda been a contenda . \" ) \\nperhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the \\'80s . \\nand , if not , it\\'s certainly perilously close to the zenith . \\n',\n",

              " 'there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor\\'s effort . \\noften a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile . \\nwhen one of these comes along , i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie , that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders . \\nbut sometimes there is simply no other explanation , and such is the case with \" the hurricane . \" \\nthis biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin \" hurricane \" carter would normally be called \" norman jewison\\'s \\'the hurricane , \\' \" as per the tradition of referring to a film \" belonging \" to a director . \\nbut though he does decent work , jewison cannot claim ownership of \" the hurricane , \" because there is one reason this film works at all , and his name is denzel washington . \\nwashington plays carter , a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late-night shooting in a bar . \\njailed for 20 years , he maintained that he had never committed the crimes , but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals . \\nthe situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter . \\nthrough the efforts of that group and carter\\'s lawyers , he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted . \\nthe film details carter\\'s childhood , which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop ( dan hedaya ) . \\nwhen he finally got out of prison for good , carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer , seemingly having his career on track , until the police framed him for multiple homicide . \\ndespite the efforts of political activists and celebrities , he remained imprisoned . \\nflash forward to 1983 , when lesra ( vicellous reon shannon ) a young african-american boy , living with a group of canadian tutors , reads the book carter wrote while in prison . \\nthe book , entitled \" the sixteenth round , \" opens young lesra\\'s eyes to the injustice that was carter\\'s life , and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer . \\nlesra convinces his canadian friends ( deborah unger , liev schreiber , john hannah ) to work with him towards his goal . \\n \" the hurricane \" leans on denzel washington . \\nhe must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will , and he does so brilliantly . \\nit\\'s probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter , because he plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be . \\nit would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin carter--a fictional personality invented solely for the film . \\nthe actor\\'s work is masterful ; washington throws himself into every moment , refusing to keep the audience at arm\\'s length . \\nwe feel everything he feels : the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life , the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight , and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost . \\nwashington\\'s is a performance of weight and emotional depth . \\nhe doesn\\'t merely play angry , happy , or sad ; he feels it at the deepest level . \\nhis work is masterful , and for half of this film i realized that the scene i was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor . \\nnorman jewison directs the film , doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection . \\n \" the hurricane \" moves quickly , with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely . \\njewison handles his multiple flashbacks well ; the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is , and nothing is terribly confusing . \\nhis boxing scenes , constructed with clear inspiration from \" raging bull , \" get inside the action very well , and they are believable as real sports footage . \\njewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick : carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform , and jewison , assisted by some wonderful acting from a game washington , shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude , and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell . \\njewison\\'s best achievement in \" the hurricane \" is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hard-knock life , and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again . \\nsadly , though , the film\\'s chief failures lie with the screenplay , as with most of the good-but-not-great efforts to round the pike this winter . \\nthere is much to interest a viewer in \" the hurricane , \" but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to take the most clich ? d route possible , it does . \\ntake a look at the supporting characters , for example , who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil . \\ncarter and lesra ( played nicely by shannon , who deserves credit ) are the only real people here ; everyone else is a stereotype . \\nthe canadians are good . \\nthe cops are bad . \\nthe canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their lovey-dovey commune ( and it is a commune , despite the film\\'s failure to make that clear ) , while every racist cop ( especially dan hedaya\\'s ) melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room . \\nmuch of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey ( \" hate put me in prison . \\nlove\\'s gonna bust me out . \" ) , and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a made-for-tv lifetime special . \\nit\\'s too bad . \\nthe cast is game , the director does his job , and the subject matter is interesting , but the script takes the safer , slightly more boring route far too often . \\ni wanted a real reason for the cop to hold a grudge against carter other than \" he\\'s a racist pig . \" \\ni wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead of a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice . \\nin short , i wanted to see the film through a less distorted lens . \\ncriticism has been levied against the liberties \" the hurricane \" takes with the truth of what really happened to carter , and much of it is deserved . \\nfor example , the film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello , only to be screwed by the judges , who ruled giardello the winner . \\nmost accounts of the fight , however , have carter losing fairly . \\nfurthermore , much of carter\\'s criminal past is conveniently left out of the film , and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained . \\nof course , \" the hurricane \" works mainly as a fable , so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially , but even dismissing such issues don\\'t remove one fact : \" the hurricane \" is a highly flawed film . \\nonly one actor could have made a schmaltzy , predictable picture like this work as well as it does , and it\\'s a good thing \" the hurricane \" has that actor . \\ncarter has been quoted as saying , \" denzel washington is making me look good , \" but he\\'s not the only one . \\nwashington makes this film look good . \\ndenzel washington\\'s \" the hurricane . \" \\nsounds pretty good to me . \\n',\n",

\" \\na guest asks impatiently . \\n \" forty million , \" groeteschele responds wryly . \\nthe problem with groeteschele\\'s mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war . \\nthe only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals . \\ngroeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over . \\nyet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off , as general black ( dan o\\'herlihy ) has often recommended . \\non the contrary--according to groeteschele , that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u . s . , which would clearly put america at a disadvantage . \\nsuch a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race . \\n \" fail-safe \" clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war , and , likewise , it becomes a central theme in the film . \\nwhy continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ? \\nis it wise ? \\nis it even logical ? \\nno , not really . \\nalthough \" fail-safe \" is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism , there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial , one-sided sort of way . \\nagain , this is achieved through groeteschele , who is easily the film\\'s most important character in terms of the larger-theme significance . \\nin addition to providing the central \" pro-nuclear war \" voice that the film warns against , he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism . \\nthe context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib . \\none of groeteschele\\'s \" logical \" trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it\\'s merely absurd . \\nhe labels the average marxist an \" unfeeling , calculating machine \" that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself . \\ngroeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u . s . drops the warhead on moscow , the soviets will * instantly * surrender , for to retaliate would invite counter-measures that would further destroy russia\\'s home soil--which must be preserved at all costs . \\ngroeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions ; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge--as any normal person would . \\nthe irony here is groeteschele\\'s own mechanical theorizing . \\nhe is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn\\'t even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns . \\nonce the film makes it evident that turning the u . s . bombers will be impossible , the question becomes what the * consequences * of destroying moscow will be . \\njust how will the soviet union\\'s leader react , and what can the president do to convey his best intentions ? \\n ( just * how * does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an * mishap * ? ) \\nwith the help of his translator buck ( larry hagman ) , the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader , in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity , with lumet\\'s long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame , exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader . \\nwithout getting into too much detail , i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly , yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances . \\n ( that is , as sensible as a nuclear \" incident \" can probably be . ) \\nit does accomplish what it must : it avoids an all-out war , something that simply isn\\'t possible because of its all-too-real consequences . \\ndramatically , the ending is quite powerful , and the use of o\\'herlihy\\'s character as the symbolic \" matador \" ( providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film\\'s opening ) , is particularly appropriate . \\n \" fail-safe \" is a production of a major hollywood studio ( released by columbia pictures ) , and it has the structure of a high-tension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film . \\nnevertheless , under lumet\\'s direction and walter bernstein\\'s intelligent adaptation of burdick\\'s and wheeler\\'s novel , the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded . \\nthe film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming . \\nbut it was the conscious , human choice to * initialize * this automatic arming that \" fail-safe \" also finds dangerous . \\nin retrospect , the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century . \\nit\\'s just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down , rather than continuing groeteschele\\'s dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown . \\n',\n",

if you don\\'t hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medical attention . \\nthe movie steers free of many of the disney conventions : there is no violence , however cartoonish , no song-and-dance number , and kiki\\'s pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comedic sidekick , although jiji is given many funny lines and scenes . \\nhowever , i would be surprised if disney doesn\\'t give jiji more jokes , or at least the voice of some comedian . \\nrefreshingly enough , the moral lesson of the movie is not self-contradicted , a habit disney movies have gotten into . \\n \" beauty and the beast \" \\'s beautiful belle , for instance , learned that beauty was derived from a person\\'s inside , and was then rewarded by having the beast turn into a handsome prince in snazzy clothing . \\nkiki , on the other hand , learns to separate her wardrobe from her self-image , and nothing more is made of her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at the end of the film . \\nanother difference with disney movies is in the style of animation for \" kiki\\'s delivery service \" : not as colorful and dynamic as disney animation can be , but with a greater attention to realism and detail , it fits the movie to a t . this is particularly true with scenes of kiki\\'s flights . \\nthe extreme realism of the birds in flight near kiki is magnificent to behold , and helps these scenes capture the wonder of flight better than any other film i\\'ve ever seen . \\ni\\'m not sure when or how this movie will be released in the united states . \\ndisney tentatively plans a theater release of \" monoko hime \" shortly following the summer \\'97 japanese release , and should start releasing the other ghibli films after that . \\ni\\'d guess that some will be released on video and some will be theatrically released in peak seasons with no competing disney release . \\nalthough the wait is unfortunate , it\\'s good to know that it\\'s being released at all , for \" kiki\\'s delivery service \" is definitely a movie worthy of widespread promotion and release . \\nwatch this movie . \\nalong with \" man bites dog , \" and perhaps something by woody allen , this is the best movie i\\'ve ever seen . \\n',\n",

\" \\nand mean it . \\nthe intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable . \\nbut sonny is no saint . \\nit turns out that he has a wandering eye , which angers his wife jessie , played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett . \\njessie gets her revenge by taking up with the church\\'s youth minister and conniving to gain control over sonny\\'s church , leaving him unemployed . \\nsonny , letting his temper get the best of him , does something foolish , which causes him to have to leave town and two beloved kids forever . \\nthe bulk of the film occurs in a small , predominately black church in louisiana , which he builds up from a derelict building with no congregation into a remodeled church ( \" one way road to heaven : holiness temple \" ) with an enthusiastic flock . \\nin this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e . f . the apostle is a hard worker willing to take on any odd job necessary to obtain the funds for his church . \\nhe asks his members to tithe , but he gives all of his money . \\nand his good deeds extend to secret donations of food for the local poor folks . \\na man who can\\'t stand to be still , he tells one of his friends , \" i quit school because i didn\\'t like recess . \" \\nin his new town he meets toosie ( miranda richardson ) , who , like him , has a family that she hasn\\'t seen in a while . \\nhis romance with the separated woman , like the rest of the film , doesn\\'t follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies . \\nbilly bob thornton shows up one day playing a local racist and general troublemaker . \\nhis confrontation with the apostle is yet another of show\\'s many surprising scenes , again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take . \\nalthough it probably couldn\\'t have ended any other way , the movie does wrap things up nicely . \\nand don\\'t miss the sweet epilogue during the film\\'s closing credits . \\na tour de force acting performance by duvall and a surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film . \\nthe apostle runs a little too long at 2 : 12 . \\nit is rated pg-13 for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up . \\n',\n",

              " \"near the end of 1996 , analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king . \\nthe following year , 1997 , saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom : twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia . \\nat best , that's all it was -- a sleeper hit , designed to surprise but not shake the industry . \\nin 1998 , however , things have been decidedly different . \\nthere have been a number of pushes on disney's death grip on the market , and fifty-one weeks into '98 , a new champion has emerged . \\ndreamworks' the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed . \\nthe other two contenders , warner brothers' quest for camelot and disney's own annual entry , mulan , lacked inspiration and drive respectively . \\nalthough camelot was borderline-abysmal , and can't really be considered a shot at the title , mulan had the makings of winner . \\nunfortunately , it was saturated with traditional , disney-cute animation , and lost points against the rapidly-changing face of the competition . \\nin making the prince of egypt , dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product . \\nthe animation is flawless , and , aside from a bug's life , is the best-looking movie to date . \\nthe animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects , and the 2d/3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with . \\nthe key to success , however , was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot . \\nnamely , some of the most important action sequences ( like the parting of the red sea ) were done almost entirely in 3d . \\ndreamworks is the first studio to prove that they've got the stuff of success , and that they're capable of challenging disney . \\nthe story is also well-written , and the characters voiced with talent . \\nfor the most part , the plot follows its source material -- the book of exodus -- although only in the most general sense . \\nthe writers took a few creative liberties , and most do not damage the story in any way . \\nin fact , the shakespearean relationship between moses ( val kilmer ) and the pharaoh rameses ( ralph fiennes ) makes the story more interesting if anything . \\nmoses , a hebrew , is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile ; he floats into the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) 's palace and is taken in by the royal family . \\nmoses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert , where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves . \\nby this time , rameses is now pharaoh , and the two brothers , now on opposite sides of the line , face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention . \\nthe cast of voices is most impressive , and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock , jeff goldblum , danny glover , and steve martin . \\nthe script does not have a lot of one-liners in it , and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams , but overall the story is exciting and interesting . \\nit's decidedly for an older crowd , and the tykes who haven't had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost . \\nbut for those who make the bid , the prince of egypt can be a great watch . \\n\",\n",

\\nwhen movies like this come along ( sort of a better version of basic instinct ) there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it . \\nthere will be people who don\\'t want to admit liking what they see , but i tell you , most anyone who sees this will like it . \\nwild things begins at blue bay high school , the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into . \\nit\\'s almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance ( totally based on looks alone ) . \\nof course , there are those select few who may look slightly ugly , but compared to the average person , they are gorgeous . \\nimmediately , the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time . \\nwe can turn off our brains , right ? \\nwrong . \\nwhile you may be expecting one thing to happen , it certainly doesn\\'t turn out that way . \\nthe film begins in a classroom , with nearly all the main characters present . \\nthere\\'s sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a counselor for the students . \\nhe\\'s heading the class discussion . \\nthere\\'s also kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam . \\nteaching the class , however , are two policemen : ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) , who want to talk about \\'sex . . . \\n ( cheers ) crimes ( boos ) \\' . \\n \" what is a sex crime ?

) , and this movie breaks the boundaries . \\ninstead of having heterosexual sex scenes , it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell ( don\\'t worry . . . \\nit\\'s not as graphic as you might think ) . \\nthe heterosexual scenes are quite graphic , but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon\\'s full-frontal nude scene . \\nit\\'s very brief , so if you blink , you may miss ( ahem ) it . \\nand , for as long as i can remember , i don\\'t think i have seen an r-rated film show an erect one before ( it\\'s not completely , but judging from the audiences\\' reaction , it was more than they expected too ) . \\nalso , during one scene late in the film , there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillon\\'s characters , but nothing came of it ( makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating , or if the actors refused to do it ) . \\nwhat first made me want to see wild things was its cast . \\nneve campbell , of course , has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released . \\nhere , however , she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead . \\nthe closest role to this was her performance in the craft ( though even in that she was a nice girl ) . \\ncampbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent . \\nyou can tell she will be around for a long time . \\ndenise richards will also be around for a long time , although she may be limited to the roles without much range . \\nhere , she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff ( yet effective ) performance in starship troopers . \\nhopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability . \\nand then there is daphne rubin-vega , a newcomer to the movies . \\nshe gives a very good performance , although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half . \\ntowards the end she does get a bigger part . \\non the male side , matt dillon is probably the best , giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist . \\nkevin bacon has a slightly wooden character , but he makes the most of it . \\nyou must have admiration , though , for what he did on screen . \\nand judging from many of the women\\'s reactions in the theater to that shot , they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon ( yeah , right ) . \\nand then there is bill murray . \\nhis performance is the comic relief , and he nearly steals the film . \\nas a whole , the entire cast works wondrously together , and they seem at home , even when doing the menage a troi . \\ndirector john mcnaughton , who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry : portrait of a serial killer , has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works . \\nhis direction is smooth and stylish . \\nthe visuals are striking , filled with rich colors , and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air . \\nhowever , he seems more at home when the actors aren\\'t talking . \\nhis fly-by shots of the swampy areas are brilliant , and his photography of denise richards\\' climbing out of the pool is a highlight . \\nthe cinematography is gorgeous in its details . its not often that you see a film like this , and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures . \\nthen , there is the music . \\nthis was probably the most obvious thing to me , as it set the perfect mood for the film . \\nit\\'s hard to describe in words , so just see the film and listen to it . \\nit\\'s wonderfully composed and presented . \\nand be sure to stick around during the closing credits ! \\nmcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use ( while most comedies use it for outtakes ) . \\nhe has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events . \\nsome may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot , but it\\'s an entertaining way to finish the film . \\nplus , there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun . \\nwild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality , nudity , language and violence . \\nagain , the nudity is rather unnecessary , but let\\'s face it--people want to see it . \\nso why not give it to them ? \\nneve campbell , admirably , has a no-nudity clause in her contract , and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off ( way to go , neve ! ) . \\nthe sex scenes are graphic , especially the first one we see , between the mother and one of her deck hands . \\none almost wonders how they got away with the r rating . \\nthe language is quite harsh too , ranging from sexual innuendo to your average , everyday profanity . \\nand i can\\'t stress it enough : don\\'t allow kids under 18 to see this film . \\nthe target age for the movie is the 18-24 range , and that\\'s who should see it . \\nit\\'s definitely not for those under 18 ! \\ndid i mention that this film is rated r ?

              " 'city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most : thought-provoking , moving , and completely unsentimental . \\ni find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant , which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality . \\ncity of angels is a wonderful film , enhanced by interesting and well-rounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years . \\nit\\'s a love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story , and avoids most of the cliches we\\'re so used to seeing in films like this . \\ncity of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders\\' 1988 film wings of desire . \\ni have yet to see wings of desire , so i am , unfortunately , unable to make a comparison of the two . \\ni have heard , however , that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways , which makes me glad that this film isn\\'t a rip-off of its source material . \\nnicolas cage stars as seth , an angel who , like all of his angel counterparts , is present to lead the dying to heaven ( or somewhere just like it ) . \\none day , he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr . maggie rice ( meg ryan ) , and his attention is called to her . \\nthe angels can make themselves seen to humans , but they can\\'t experience any of the senses ( most importantly , touch ) . \\nhe shows himself to maggie , and she falls for him , unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status . \\nseth wants to become human so he can feel her . \\nthat\\'s when he meets nathaniel messinger ( dennis franz ) , \" former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race . \" \\n ( as a side note , i found messinger to be the most fascinating character , for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death . ) \\nmessinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human . \\nseth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel ( i know , it sounds ridiculous , but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally well-done ) ; after much deliberation , she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel . \\nthis , of course , is when seth decides to take the plunge ( literally ) from a building ; when he wakes up from the fall , he is human , and happy to feel what it\\'s like to have a split lip and blood oozing from his forehead . \\nsince i love this film so much , i\\'ll make a minor note that it certainly isn\\'t perfect . \\nalthough it is original and mesmerizing , it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre . \\nthe plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rather formulaic ( though the details are what make the story excellent , and steel has done a great job with them ) . \\nthe ending , too , could have been more powerful and less predictable . \\nthese elements are minor , though , and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels . \\nthe acting is superb from everyone involved . \\nthis is perhaps my second-favorite performance from cage ( my favorite being the rock ) . \\nhe\\'s quiet and pensive , and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softly-toned words . \\nhe\\'s perfect for a role like this , and at the same time he reassures us he\\'s not bound by playing the psycho ( though he is good at it , as he shows in face/off ) . \\nmeg ryan is a powerful , enticing , and appealingly-chirpy actress , and her work here is some of her best . \\ndennis franz , however , steals all of his scenes as the energetic former-angel . \\nwhat i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation . \\ndirector brad silberling is a talented man , and he knows that a story like this is driven by the characters , rather than forced sentimentality . \\nhis direction is steady , and he shows this in just about every scene : near the beginning , maggie has to tell a mother and her two children that their father is dead . \\nthere is no music or elaborate camera work ; we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information . \\nthis is the way stories should be told , and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real . \\nthe film also appeals to the senses in a way that few love stories do . \\ncinematographer john seale ( the english patient ) provides some of the most stunning images i\\'ve seen on the big screen : hundreds of black-clad angels stand on a dim beach in the early morning hours ( just as an example ) . \\nthe music , by gabriel yared ( also of the english patient ) , is perfect for this film : it\\'s quiet and moody music ( but not sentimental ! ) , and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely . \\nthe visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far . \\nall of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre . \\nit\\'s a film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story across--the excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously . \\n',\n",

\\nthe film confronts all these problems , paradoxically , by not cronfronting them . \\nit doesn\\'t simply plug in the \" right thing \" at the \" right time , \" it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant . \\nbuilding a strong foundation is important to all forms of media , without which , what is there to build on ? \\nwe\\'re given some backstory here and learn a little about our characters , especially our main character , scarlett o\\'hara ( leigh ) , a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel , a cunning wit , and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time . \\nshe knows how her society works , wherein everything she does can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her . \\nright from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be . \\nbeing the most sought-after woman allows her to manipulate men ( and their women ) to ensure she gets her way , whether it be obvious ( i . e . \\nwho will be the one to get her food ) , or subtle ( i . e . \\ngetting married just to spite someone ) . \\nthe man she claims to love is ashley wilkes ( howard ) , a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him . \\nhe isn\\'t so arrogant and demanding as scarlett , in fact , he\\'s engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his . \\nher name is melanie ( de havilland ) , and she is one of the sweetest , kindest , and most likable characters one will ever see . \\nshe and scarlett become very dear friends , but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her , and the love she has for her husband . \\nher meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic - it defines who she is , but doesn\\'t give her much emotional self-defense . \\nacting a catalyst to the love triangle , and to the story as a whole is the daper , stong-willed , cunning , cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler ( gable ) . \\nhe\\'s quite a character all right - everyone listens to what he has to say even though he\\'s got a bad reputation . \\nbutler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior . \\nhe tells everyone the much-needed truth in the rigid caste-like society where freewill doesn\\'t seem to exist , everything is done out of honor and tradition . \\nfor example , in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there\\'s no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out . \\nthis angers them , not for his lack of faith , but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that . \\n \" do we have ammunition factories ? \\ndo we have food ? \\ndo we have a navy ? \\nall we have is tobacco . \" \\nall true statements and yet the south still insists he\\'s wrong . \\nbutler is a shifty character to be sure , but he takes such pride in his arrogance it\\'s appealing . \\nscarlett notices this too when she first sees him , and from the look butler gives her , we know he\\'s not going to stop until he has her . \\nbut scarlett can\\'t get past her need for ashley , and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story , butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever . \\nand so the story goes on , with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life . \\nthe conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband , especially after she is \" marked \" for life when her first husband dies . \\nthis gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story . \\nsome are vital for only a few scenes , but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film . \\nin most films only a few characters exist for support in background , but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance . \\neven people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set . \\nthe costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place . \\nthe filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside , real world , but these types of simple approaches are never taken . \\nthe first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war . \\nfleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is . \\none scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming , \" no ! \\nnot my leg ! \\ndon\\'t cut off my leg ! \" \\nanother scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street , but as the camera pulls back , we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers , but it is their moaning that\\'s more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be . \\nas the second half begins , the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who single-handedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north . \\nshe manages to resurrect the family plantation , but all the willpower she has can\\'t help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the south\\'s ultimate defeat . \\nthis brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love- hate relationship . \\nmost of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship ( or lack thereof ) between rhett and scarlett . \\neach uses the other for personal gain , but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other . \\nscarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett can\\'t help but want her more every time she tries to one-up him such as marrying another man and taking over his business . \\nthey say opposites attract , but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities , it borders on magnetic polarization . \\nthey need each other and know this , yet they never seem truly happy together . \\nperhaps they mistake love for passion , and the film leaves it up to us to make this call . \\nboth have things the other wants and vice versa , but when they compromise , is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other . \\nlove and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film , we\\'re left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why . \\ngable and leigh do have great chemistry , always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture . \\nall ?

\\ni somehow doubt it - the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isn\\'t attempting to be the utter farce which it is . \\narnold schwarzenegger is top-billed in the film as the villainous mr . freeze , and is bland and uninteresting , perhaps the worst thing that a villain can be . \\nmr . schwarzenegger\\'s attempts to be menacing are laughable , and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable ; frankly , everything he does onscreen is laughable . \\nby the end of the film , i was stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen . \\nthe bulk of his performance consists of uttering near-unintelligble puns and one-liners featuring every possible permutation of \" cool ! \" \\nin the least inventive way . \\ngeorge clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin , being overshadowed by the villains , and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film . \\nhis batman is hardly an imposing figure . \\nchris o\\'donnell is unimpressive in a one-note performance , while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all . \\nthe film\\'s one saving grace ? \\nundoubtably uma thurman\\'s entertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy . \\nher work in batman and robin is certainly over-the-top , but in a controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone of the film . \\nms . thurman\\'s comic timing is impeccable , and reminds us that it takes skilled performers to make campiness work successfully . \\n ( i\\'m already starting to positively reassess jim carrey\\'s performance in batman forever . ) \\nher amusing poison ivy is the most entertaining character in the film , and when she\\'s offscreen the film greatly suffers . \\ni figure that if one has to die , being kissed to death by uma thurman isn\\'t a half-bad way to go . \\nwhile batman and robin was hardly a ride of pulse-pounding excitement , i must admit that i was not bored watching it , although i did glance at my watch repeatedly through the screening - my attention was kept through anticipation of the utterance of yet another terrible pun or one-liner , and by awaiting yet another scene to fall flat . \\nit\\'s been a long time since i\\'ve laughed so much at a movie . \\n \" at \" , of course , is the operative word . \\n',\n",

              " 'seen september 13 , 1998 at 4 p . m at rotterdam square mall cinema 6 , theater #2 , with chris wessell for free using my sony/loews critic\\'s pass . \\n[theater rating : * * 1/2 : good seats , average sound , picture unstable] \\n \" rounders \" is exactly the kind of movie parents don\\'t want their kids to see . \\nit\\'s not that it\\'s a drunken orgy of sex and violence , but because it\\'s a film that flat-out says you can make a career out of gambling . \\nand to take make things \" worse \" it proves this through its original , fascinating story . \\nthere have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the \" noir \" mood , that is , the dark , shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life . \\nthis film starts off in the tradiational noir style , introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing . \\nmatt damon stars as mike mcdermott , a 20-something law student in present-day new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played . \\ndamon narrates throughout the film , but the entire opening scene is voiced-over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting . \\nmike\\'s about to go up against teddy kgb ( malkovich ) , a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer . \\nbut then again , he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense - the look in his eyes , his slow movements , his intricate mannerisms - all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld ( literally ) . \\ndamon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly-groomed features , but his narration is what brings it all together . \\nhe never sounds like he\\'s reading from a script , nor that he\\'s trying to embellish anything , it just comes natural to him . \\nthe screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood , from the smell of the air , to the logic involved in reading the other guys\\' faces and cards , and all without sounding remotely trite . \\nimmediately we get the sense that poker isn\\'t for gamblers , but for near- geniuses with nerves of steel . \\nthe game is a quiet war , with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers . \\nthe gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car , but when it comes to the game of poker , all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man . \\nthe film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act . \\nit concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit . \\nwe learn only a little about mike , both past and present . \\npresently we know he has a girlfriend named jo ( gretchen mol ) who he constantly argues with over his gambling . \\nthey go through a few break-up/make-up cycles until mike\\'s childhood pal and fellow rounder \" worm \" ( norton ) is released from prison . \\nit\\'s not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob , but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does . \\ntechnically , the plot isn\\'t unlike many children\\'s sitcoms in which the \" good \" kid\\'s \" bad \" friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid . \\nwhat this film does is use a different medium to tell that story . \\nmike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives , but both share a passion for out-thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them . \\nwhere as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating ( hence his jail time ) , mike always takes the cards he\\'s dealt and works with them . \\nsometimes they pay off ( i . e . \\nhis ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money ) , but other times they don\\'t ( i . e . \\nthe fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job after dropping $30 , 000 on a single hand ) . \\nonce things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood . \\nmike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places , from socialites\\' mansions , to taking the tourists at atlantic city , to outwitting the gangsters that control it all . \\neverything they come into contact with is a big poker game in that everything\\'s a battle against the cards destiny deals . \\none scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge ( martin landou , in a perfectly cast and performed role ) that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time . \\nmatt\\'s good at gambling but he\\'s also got potential to be a great lawyer . \\nhe could go professional as either , but with one he could lose everything or win big , but with the other there\\'s stability but not much risk involved . \\ncan someone who\\'s gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave ? \\nif the film had been just a subtle lesson in poker-playing , then the ending is our test . \\neverything is told from mike\\'s perspective , but we\\'re finally able to recognize some things on our own . \\nthis makes the final , against-all- odds showdown seem like just that . \\nit works just like the game it revolves around - showing us some of the cards , but still evokes the element of the unknown , and the consequences thereof . \\nwhat separates \" rounders \" from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end . \\n',\n",

              " 'a movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings . \\nfamily breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years , and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in hand-wringing detail . \\nstill , i can\\'t recall a comedy about the subject before bye bye love . \\nand after it , i still can\\'t . \\nbye bye love is rarely funny , more often a weak and melodramatic retread of common tv-movie fare . \\nonly a few moments which have nothing to do with the film\\'s main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion . \\nbye bye love follows one weekend in the lives of three divorced fathers who get weekend custody of their children . \\ndave ( matthew modine ) , a father of two , is an inveterate womanizer having difficulty staying faithful to his latest girlfriend ; vic ( randy quaid ) is a foul-humored father of three about to go on a rare date ; donny ( paul reiser ) pines for his ex-wife and has trouble relating to his teenage daughter emma ( eliza dushku ) . \\nover the course of the weekend , the three men face various crises , including vic\\'s blind date from hell ( janeane garofolo ) and donny\\'s growing estrangement from emma . \\nthe three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo , and the quality of their performances is of widely varying quality . \\nrandy quaid is the best of the three , bitter without being irritating , gleefully spiteful without being frightening . \\nhis run-ins with is ex-wife ( lindsey crouse ) are a bit over-played , though , and his confrontation with a pompous radio psychologist ( rob reiner ) is gimmicky and implausible . \\nhe does get bye bye love\\'s best sub-plot , a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo , and he does a great slow burn . \\npaul reiser really has only one character , his slightly befuddled , uptight nice guy \" mad about you \" persona , but he does it well . \\nas a personality , he is appealing , but as a character , he becomes pretty boring here . \\nmatthew modine , is , quite simply , terrible . \\nthis isn\\'t a performance good enough to be called mailed-in ; he even forgot to put a stamp on it . \\nmodine lacks any charm in an appallingly under-written role , looks bored most of the time , and gets stuck with a trite little speech about how it\\'s all his father\\'s fault he\\'s such a cad . \\ncarolco\\'s executives , whose entire future is resting on modine\\'s bankability for the upcoming cutthroat island , must be sweating buckets right now . \\nbye bye love basically comes off as a very confused movie , because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids , making it just another \" dating in the 90s \" movie . \\nwhen the movie does deal with the children at all , it is to have one of them scream out an accusation and/or cry , perhaps to be resolved later by a sensitive talk and a hug , perhaps not . \\neven more confusing is a sub-plot featuring the late ed flanders as a widower who goes to work and a mcdonald\\'s and befriends a troubled youth . \\nit is a sad end to flanders\\' career , getting caught up in a truly annoying over-use of mcdonald\\'s as a location , a plot device and , apparently , a major advertiser . \\neven if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parent-child relationships , it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off , because ultimately there is very little humor one can wring from family break-ups and their effects on children . \\nany way you slice it , it is a bad situation for kids , and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue . \\nit is left to the dads\\' romantic fumblings to probide what little humor there is , and it isn\\'t enough . \\nthere have been comparisons between bye bye love and parenthood , but parenthood was both genuinely funny and genuinely touching . \\nbye bye love is a genuine shame . \\n',\n",

              " 'the general\\'s daughter is a heartless , absurd film , a movie so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own characters . \\ndirector simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with ham-handed obscenity , creating a film that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudo-depth . \\nwhat\\'s worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic -- the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm . \\njohn travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess , playing warrant officer paul brenner ; brenner is assigned to find the murderer and rape of captain elizabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) . \\nbrenner is teamed up with ex-spouse sarah sunderland ( madeline stowe ) , and they check out all the suspects on the base , including elizabeth\\'s mentor , colonel moore ( james woods ) . \\nsoon , it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff , but the question comes down to why -- and , of course , who . \\nebert\\'s law of the economy of characters can be applied here ; one interesting thing i noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point ( including the two protagonists ) , but almost all of them end up directly intertwined with the story . \\nperhaps i should have issued a spoiler alert before mentioning that , but it\\'s painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in the film is hiding something . \\non a story level , the general\\'s daughter is ineptly constructed . \\nthe film , adapted by christopher bertolini and william goldman from nelson demille\\'s novel ( which was apparently based on a true story ) , plods along to its conclusion , filling in the blanks with stale , unrealistic dialogue and \" shocking \" plot developments . \\nhaving not read the novel , it\\'s difficult to determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author , but i suppose they all are guilty to some degree . \\nscene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity ; minutes after finding the dead young woman , brenner and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue , which includes endless strings of forced lines . \\n ( sunderland actually asks brenner , \" why was she killed ? \" \\nto which i would have answered , \" if i knew , then the movie would already be over . \" ) \\nonly after we\\'ve spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together ; this angle , though apparently present to develop their characters , is never explored . \\nnot that it really matters , since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot . \\nin one scene , sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask . \\nshe sees one of his rings , and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring . \\ninstead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect , they take him to brenner\\'s houseboat , beat him up , and pour hot coffee in his lap . \\nthis scene really pushed me over the edge , not because it\\'s gratuitous and mean-spirited , but because it illustrates the film\\'s complete disregard for the characters and the audience . \\nit was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene , mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise . \\ni realized that these constructs on screen aren\\'t actually characters , but devices present only to serve the story . \\nthis would have been bad enough without the west\\'s need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct . \\ncompelling films about sexual crimes don\\'t spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks , and they certainly don\\'t show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture . \\nthese scenes are not the least bit powerful ; on the contrary , they\\'re intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain , whomever that may turn out to be . \\nin addition , the movie treats sexual fetishes -- and sadomasochism in particular -- as if it\\'s a perversion of everything we know to be pure . \\nthis standpoint is certainly allowed , but only in accompaniment with well-developed themes to back it up . \\nas it is , the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes , and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane . \\nperhaps the only positive elements in the general\\'s daughter are a couple of the performances . \\njames woods has a few terrific scenes , and plays his role with sharp , witty subtlety . \\ni also liked james cromwell , mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous . \\nnonetheless , these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary , obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization . \\nthe general\\'s daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film -- it pretends to have a soul , to be of strict moral code , when in fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cut-outs force-feeding the audience a toxic landfill of plot contrivances and one-sided moral judgments . \\n',\n",

a film without much center . \\n , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) \\npierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a . k . a . monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire . \\nit reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver\\'s travels . \\nhumans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift\\'s island of the houyhnhnms . \\nthe novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet . \\nit seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that . \\nwhen rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish . \\nthe final irony of the original version has become film history . \\nwithout it there could never have been a \" planet of the apes \" film series . \\ni can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language . \\nin the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language . \\nthat could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking . \\nserling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film . \\njustifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending . \\nbut serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear . \\nfew viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history . \\npartial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith\\'s best if not his best . \\nwhen the film\\'s success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s . \\nwhile the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases . \\nthe series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 . \\nnow director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again . \\nfor those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton\\'s new version is even less faithful . \\nfirst , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes . \\nhe has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes . \\nthat could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes . \\nas with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring . \\nin 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world\\'s most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes . \\nthen a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard-of-oz-fashion and drops him on an alien planet . \\n ( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect . ) \\nhe quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks . \\nand the language they talk is earth- english . \\napparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that . \\nthe fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn\\'t occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film . \\nboth just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english . \\nin any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships . \\noutside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic . \\nleo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter . \\nari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power . \\nshe is bent on making the world a better place . \\nperhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil-ari . \\nin any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout , carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film . \\nshe may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward . \\nit is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes . \\nthis is a further abandonment of the source material . \\nthe chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each\\'s place in this reversed society , each important in the book . \\nwe cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down . \\nwe see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them . \\nburton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn . \\nthis is a miscalculation , as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in . \\nthey are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win . \\nthe 1968 script had little subtlety , with lines like \" i never met an ape i didn\\'t like , \" but at least we cared for what happened to taylor , the main character . \\nmost of what this film has to offer is in the visuals . \\nthe visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog . \\nthis tends to limit close looks at the makeup . \\nin general it seems much improved from 1968 . \\nthe makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers , who did it for the 1968 version . \\nin 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper . \\nit was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion . \\nchambers is good , but if anyone

work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make . \\nthey look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger , hidden dragon . \\napes spring incredible distances . \\nsome of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture , but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost . \\none final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close-up . \\nsince the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make-up . \\nthe one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti . \\nit is not that his lines are so good , most are silly jokes . \\nbut he delivers them very well . \\nhe was always a watchable actor , but has not yet made stardom . \\nas the ape-trader limbo he over-emotes to overcome his ape make-up , but does it very well . \\nin doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen . \\nhe is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov\\'s performance in spartacus . \\nas an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself . \\ndanny elfman\\'s score has a nice primitive feel , but jerry goldsmith\\'s 1968 tour de force score is a real classic . \\nthat score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten . \\ni rate the remake 4

know from the original , this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet . \\nhowever , the children that are bred are half-human , as their father is . \\npatrick is really looking for another alien to breed with , and he finds it in eve ( natasha henstridge ) . \\neve was cloned from dna taken from sil , the original alien . \\nhowever , this time around , most of her \" alien \" urges have been either decreased dramatically , or lie dormant . \\nthe project is led by dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , reprising her role from species ) , and her motives seem respectable . \\nsince she was involved with the original alien attack , she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again . \\nand it has . \\nstory-wise , species ii is much stronger than its predecessor , but it is also much stronger than , say , aliens ( hey , i love the film , but you can\\'t tell me it was strong on story ) . \\nwhat surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay . \\nin my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college , we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles . \\nthis piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars ( later , it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it ) . \\nthe script uses this effectively , but also manages to provide a well-balanced plot . \\nbeginning with the first man on mars ( something i have always dreamed of seeing ) , i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie . \\nand it does it quite well . \\nthe characters are all smart , and they know what to do and what not to do . \\nthe only character that seems a little cliched is the general ( george dzundza ) , and yet , he remains logical in everything he does . \\nthere are the obvious flaws of course , mostly lying in the technical aspects . \\nthe special effects are only mediocre , and some are just plain bad . \\nbut for the most part , they remain believable ( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children ) . \\nalso , the most realistic ones are usually the goriest , ranging from people being torn open , or someone\\'s head being blown off . \\nhowever , some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience , including a menage a troi that is all but necessary . \\nmany people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex , nudity , and gory violence . \\nhowever , i tend to disagree . \\nwhat were the alien films about ? \\nand , if an alien species ever did come to earth , and their sole purpose was to destroy us , wouldn\\'t you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible ? \\nmy only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store . \\ni didn\\'t realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with ( i just assume it is his part-human side looking for the most beautiful one ) . \\nthe acting is quite good for this kind of film . \\nit is a vast improvement over the first film , at least . \\nthe acting is the key element to this film : if it was bad , it would have lowered itself into camp ; if it was good , it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens . \\nokay , so it isn\\'t that good . \\ngeorge dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting , as his over-the-top impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting . \\nnatasha henstridge is limited this time around , as she is usually enclosed in a cage . \\nhowever , she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent . \\noh yeah , and she\\'s quite fun to just plain watch . \\nmarg helgenberger is immensely better this time around , and her performance is probably the best in this film . \\nmichael madsen is so-so , but he isn\\'t annoying , and he soon becomes rather appealing ( with his nice cynic personality ) . \\njames cromwell has a small part , but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor . \\nas i say , any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability . \\nmykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance , and he gives the film a more down-to-earth feel . \\nand , of course , justin lazard . \\nlazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance , but i think he is effective . \\nsure , he is wooden , but isn\\'t that what his character is like ? \\nthe moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done , due to the couple\\'s acting . \\nspecies ii is rated r for strong sexuality , sci-fi violence/gore and language . \\nthis is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see . \\nmore than likely , they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives . \\nhell , i don\\'t even know if i will . \\nwhat is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year . \\ni probably won\\'t see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while . \\ndirector peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful , and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series . \\nmedak has also mastered the wonderful \" jump ! \" \\nmoments , and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film ( scream still has the first ) . \\nstrong acting , smart dialogue , intelligent plotting , and a sure-handed director , species ii is exactly what these films should be : entertaining . \\n',\n",

\\nyes . \\ndoes it matter ? \\nnot really . \\nthe film opens in october of 1969 . \\nfirefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job , then goes home to his loving wife julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) and son johnny ( daniel henson ) . \\nthe double-pronged story flashes forward to 1999 , where johnny ( now jim caviezel ) is all grown up and working as a police detective . \\na strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city -- allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in \\'69 and that john has found in the present day . \\nthough both are initially skeptical of the idea , john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire , and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom . \\nnow flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive , john is initially overjoyed , until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous : a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women . \\nfrank and john now must work together to set things right , with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past . \\nthe premise of \" frequency \" is unusual , and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept : john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions . \\nthis isn\\'t explained ; you just have to go with it . \\nwhen frank doesn\\'t die in a fire , john is the only one who remembers it differently , while everyone else remembers it the new way . \\nthe concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each other . \\nsometimes frank\\'s changing the past results in something happening right away in john\\'s world , and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time . \\nnow , the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this , and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted ( but nevertheless logical ) if i thought about it hard enough ( for example , the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer\\'s murders was because the change had already happened in frank\\'s world , and john is only witnessing the * projection * of that change ) , but explanations aren\\'t really the point . \\nwhen \" frequency \" gets cooking , it\\'s a riveting little thriller , even if it is confusing . \\nwhat matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment , and \" frequency \" works as long as it keeps moving . \\nthe film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion . \\ndirector gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure \" frequency \" as good hollywood entertainment , establishing decent , likable characters , making us care for them , and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved . \\ni liked many of the creative touches : the split screens , allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities , and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward . \\nit actually uses the 1969 mets-orioles world series ( the one that featured the amazin\\' mets ) to great effect -- frank uses john\\'s advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him . \\n ( admittedly , this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself . ) \\ni even liked the final scene , which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods . \\nsome may find this scene blindingly confusing , as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious , but it does make sense if you think about it ( and give the script a lot of leeway ) , and let\\'s face it : it\\'s a darn cool way to end the film . \\nthere are enough surprises and plot twists in \" frequency \" to keep you on your toes , and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant . \\nthe other major thing to appreciate about \" frequency \" is the handling of the father-son relationship . \\nquaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily ; it\\'s a rock-solid job from both actors . \\nthe relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept : how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative , or with a future descendant ? \\nwatching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question . \\nthe credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film ; if we don\\'t believe in the characters , we don\\'t care about the outcome of the thriller plot . \\nhere , we do care , because we like the lead actors . \\ni also liked some of the supporting cast members . \\nelizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles , playing julia the doting wife * and * mother , but still performs admirably . \\nandre braugher , late of the television show \" homicide : life on the street , \" gives a nice supporting turn as frank\\'s best friend and future colleague of john . \\nhe has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank\\'s world series predictions come true before his very eyes . \\nbraugher strikes the perfect facial expression here , simultaneously dismayed and amused . \\nperhaps the only thing i didn\\'t like about \" frequency \" is the overly sentimental coda , during which the camera\\'s focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard . \\nbut that\\'s only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics . \\ni freely acknowledge that \" frequency \" may best work as a \" guy \" movie , since it focuses on the very male-oriented idea of father-son relationships ( echoes of \" field of dreams \" can be easily heard ) , but the underlying concept is universally applicable . \\nwho wouldn\\'t want to speak with a long-dead parent ?

good seats , sound , and picture] \\nwar is a topic that can\\'t help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media . \\nmovies , documentaries , and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on , such as strategy , politics , and victory . \\nit\\'s easy to forget war , in its most basic form , is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other . \\nforgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier , no matter what his rank or importance , is a real flesh-and-blood person and not just a number . \\n \" saving private ryan \" is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect , especially in its unapologetic , realistic delivery . \\nit proves there\\'s a huge difference between battling and killing . \\nthe film opens with one of the most graphic , disturbing scenes in recent memory . \\nit\\'s world war ii , d-day to be exact , and the u . s . military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them . \\nspielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality . \\ninstead of positioned cameras , the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared . \\nthere is no sense of stability , but of constant , anxious , and confusing motion , giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle , and just a vulnerable as the poor troops . \\n \" poor \" is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are . \\nthere is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters . \\nwe don\\'t get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles , but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding . \\nthe nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated , but as people that must be destroyed because they\\'re there . \\nin the movies , the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get a scratch , but in reality that wouldn\\'t happen . \\nthe men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies . \\nthey are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the well-secured germans who can actually see who , what , and where they\\'re shooting , unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off . \\nperhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are , but that seems to be part of the theme . \\nthe film seems to rely on the audience\\'s sense of patriotism , that the american military is \" right \" and good and that the nazis are \" inherently evil . \" \\nthe battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold ( a whole 50-foot progression ) , and begin to inflict some damage . \\ni have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up , i couldn\\'t help but feel some sense of joy and relief . \\nto triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure , but there\\'s nothing cliche about the graphic , detailed , atmosphere here because it really happened . \\none of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is , and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting . \\nthe plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet . \\ntom hanks stars as captain miller , a relatively average man who happens to be the leader of a platoon . \\nhe\\'s never obsessive or any such generic , cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like this . \\nhe doesn\\'t want to be there any more than his men , but when he is given a mission he intends to carry it out . \\nthe mission the film is concerned with is , as the title states , saving private ryan . \\nthrough a series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker , it is brought to a general\\'s attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of each\\'s death simultaneously . \\nwhen they learn a fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe , they make it a top priority to have him returned safely to his mother . \\nit\\'s easy to sympathize with this situation , after all , no one should have to lose all their children at once . \\nbut finding one man in this war is , as miller puts it , \" like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles . \" \\nthe saving of private ryan isn\\'t just a dramatic device , but a thematic one . \\nhis salvation represents the sense of innocence the country , the world even , was trying to convince itself it still had . \\nwhen miller\\'s company hears of the mission , they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead , but miller isn\\'t so quick to shrug it off . \\nhe knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope , and now he has the opportunity to make someone\\'s sense of hope a reality . \\nthe mission to find ryan gives miller\\'s group a destination , but not direction . \\nalong the way many things happen to them , both good and bad . \\na few battles are fought , not to be major accomplishments for the war , but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice . \\nthe act of killing itself becomes one of the film\\'s major philosophical metaphors . \\nthe soldiers don\\'t mind killing other soldiers in blind battle , but when they come across a lone survivor who begs them to let him go , they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses . \\nunfortunately , death is a fact of war , and most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters , but here spielberg doesn\\'t want us to think these men are invincible . \\nin fact , only a small amount of color and personality is sketched into each man , and the performances are good enough to make this method work . \\nalthough the characters are somewhat typical , the actors maintain control over the material at all time . \\nwhether they\\'re arguing with each other , telling stories of back home , or fighting the germans , they never go overboard and always

tale of a homeless madman-cum-detective who , on the morning of february 14th , discovers a \" valentine \" just outside his new york cave : one of ella fitzgerald\\'s strange fruit , stuck in the crotch of a tree--a young male model murdered and frozen to a branch . \\nbelieving at first that his imagined nemesis stuyvesant , shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler building , is responsible for the murder , romulus ( samuel l . jackson ) is put on the trail of an avant-garde photographer in the mapplethorpe mould , david leppenraub ( colm feore ) . \\nhis minor sleuthing interrupted by the occasional delusional fit and bouts with an ecstasy of creation ( romulus was a brilliant julliard-trained pianist prior to his psychosis ) , romulus uncovers clues and harasses suspects on his way to convincing his police-woman daughter ( aunjanue ellis ) that even though he\\'s a nut , that doesn\\'t mean that he can\\'t solve a high-profile society murder . \\nevery moment an exhausting workshop of ideas , and every character the same , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is a concept so \" high concept \" that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment , with romulus\\'s \" caveman \" a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlane\\'s urban noir hero , spawn . \\nwith a long-vanished wife ( tamara tunie ) acting as a spiritual guide , the occasional social caste commentary , the secret base in a cave , a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters , and a wickedly colourful arch-enemy , the film piles on the lurid comic book details and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars weren\\'t inscribed with \" gotham pd . \" \\nthat being said , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy , a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart . \\nthe difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when , in fact , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless ( again like mcfarlane\\'s spawn ) while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts . \\nit is no small detail that our hero , romulus , is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life ( in legend ) without knowledge of his royal birth , but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park . in the romulus mythology , signs of romulus\\' royal blood is brought by twelve vultures , while in the film , the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds , but of the carrion itself . \\nwhether or not romulus of _the caveman\\'s valentine_ will found a nation , or , in the case of novelist george dawes green , upon whose novel his own screenplay is based , a franchise , the fact remains that _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is easily the most misunderstood film of 2001 thus far . \\nit , along with m . night shyamalan\\'s _unbreakable_ , is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has , since miller\\'s seminal \" the dark knight returns \" , redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics . \\nreaders of sam keith\\'s brilliant \" the maxx \" comic series ( or of mtv\\'s short-lived animated adaptation of the same ) are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne . \\nthe failure of both \" the maxx \" tv show and of _the caveman\\'s valentine_ ( not forgetting the initial backlash against _unbreakable_ ) suggests that the public may not be ready for america\\'s surprising contributions to dark fantasy . \\nluxuriantly lit , brashly saturated , and comic-panel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent ( _death in venice , ca_ ) , while inhabiting robin standefer\\'s ( _practical magic_ ) mesmerizing sets , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is an unremittingly gorgeous film . \\nkasi lemmons , following up her brilliant 1997 debut , _eve\\'s bayou_ , which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism , fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys , artists and suffering . \\n_the caveman\\'s valentine_ is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape . \\nclearly not for every taste , when approached with the correct paradigm , it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year : a redefinition of the hero archetype for a post-modern audience with urine-stained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes . \\n_the caveman\\'s valentine_ is a fine and a courageous film , crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliot\\'s rat\\'s alley wasteland . \\n',\n",

i\\'d frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often . \\nit was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend\\'s wedding was such a success - a strong , bouyant romantic-comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects , featuring a triumphant performance from ms . roberts . \\nthe heroine of my best friend\\'s wedding is julianne potter ( julia roberts ) , a successful new york restaurant critic , and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes ( rupert everett ) that years ago , she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex-lover michael o\\'neal ( dermot mulroney ) , a sports writer , that if they both hadn\\'t married by the time they reached 28 , they had promised to marry each other . \\nboth julianne and michael are both single , of course , and when george inquires about michael\\'s age , julianne realizes that he\\'s mere weeks away from his 28th birthday , and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day . \\nhowever , she finds herself even more distraught when michael\\'s call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace ( cameron diaz ) , and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding , julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael , and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary . \\nthe setup for my best friend\\'s wedding , then , is a fairly conventional one , and in many ways the film\\'s storyline is formulaic - but only to a certain extent : the film was directed by p . j . hogan , whose first feature , muriel\\'s wedding , had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly-duckling story , and the same holds true for my best friend\\'s wedding , which confidently combines traditional romantic-comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour . \\nthe film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr . hogan . \\nfor example , there\\'s a heartfelt , emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film - with a trio of teenagers , inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks , harmonizing in the background . \\nmy best friend\\'s wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film , and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect - it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen\\'s everyone says i love you ; i\\'d even assert it\\'s a more successful one . \\nmy best friend\\'s wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well . \\nin a typical romantic-comedy , kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty , conniving ice queen , and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps ; this film is smarter than that - here , kimmy is sweet , sincere , and innocent ; julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy\\'s life , she\\'d actually like her too . \\nthe george character is almost a staple of recent film - the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason - but in my best friend\\'s wedding , he gets to have a playful , mischievous and charming personality . \\nthroughout the film , the formulaisms one often sees is romantic-comedy are given little twists , and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion . \\nthere is a lot of smart writing in the well-paced screenplay by ronald bass ; we\\'re given four interesting , vivid , and likeable characters , with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments . \\nmy best friend\\'s wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts , who turns in a top-notch , confident and reassured performance as julianne . \\nthis isn\\'t the sort of role one usually associates with ms . roberts - the julianne character\\'s neurotic , fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role - but ms . roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here , remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience , if not entirely sympathetic , even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable . \\neven better than ms . roberts though is cameron diaz , who turns in a shining performance in my best friend\\'s weddding . \\nwith a smile which lights up the screen , she effectively conveys kimmy\\'s insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner , and never hits a false note in the film . \\nshe even sings - i won\\'t soon forget her charming serenade of \" i just don\\'t know what to do with myself \" . \\nrupert everett is given a very juicy role as george , and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film . \\nhis george is a bit of a devilish rogue , entirely affable , and mr . everett\\'s performance is a delight to watch ; he\\'s clearly having fun , and his joy is infectuous . \\ndermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role - unlike the other characters in the film , he\\'s not given a lot to do , but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms . roberts and mr . mulroney , and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic . \\nwhen julia roberts\\' lustre began to fade , and she was usurped from her title as \" america\\'s sweetheart \" by sandra bullock , i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile . \\nwhile that didn\\'t quite work out , it\\'s near-certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990 , the romantic-comedy , will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game . \\nmy best friend\\'s wedding marks a return to form for ms . roberts , and cements p . j . hogan\\'s reputation as a skilled director of comedy . \\n',\n",
              " 'director dominic sena ( who made the highly underrated kalifornia ) and producer jerry bruckheimer ( the rock , armageddon ) bring us a slick and entertaining remake of the 1974 film of the same name that absolutely no one has ever seen . \\nnicolas cage plays memphis , a retired car thief who\\'s \" pulled back in \" to the business by an evil car thief overlord ( christopher eccleston ) determined to kill memphis\\' kid brother ( giovanni ribisi ) . \\nmemphis is ordered to steal 50 cars in four days time or his brother will meet an unfortunate demise , all while having to elude the detectives hot on his trail and a rival car thief who feels the job should have been given to him and his gang . \\nmemphis sets out to put his old crew back together , but discovers that most of them have retired as well . \\ngone in sixty seconds does things right from the opening credits . \\nin that sequence , we get a rockin\\' little tune from moby , along with some simple back story told only with photographs and assorted objects . \\nfilmmakers can sometimes make or break a film just from its opening title sequence , and this one easily gets you in the mindset for an entertaining ride . \\nand what follows doesn\\'t disappoint . . . \\ncage turns in one of his good performances here ( he can easily go either way . . . \\ngood or bad . . . \\ni don\\'t know how he does that ) , and his mannerisms and dialogue delivery carry the film along nicely . \\nof the supporting cast members , angelina jolie as memphis\\' former love is in the film just to provide eye candy ( she\\'s definitely the hottest looking grease monkey i\\'ve ever seen ) and robert duvall as memphis\\' former mentor is just around to lend the film some class . \\nalso , i\\'m a big fan of will patton ( armageddon , the postman ) and would love to see him get a huge role someday . \\nnone of these three performers are given much to do unfortunately . \\nsome underrated performers however are given meaty supporting roles . \\ndelroy lindo ( get shorty ) shines as the exasperated detective in pursuit of memphis , as does timothy olyphant ( go ) as lindo\\'s partner . \\ni just wish some of the other characters could have been as important . \\nthe only real gripe i have about the film though is its conclusion . . . \\nmainly because you know how it will end before the opening credits even roll . \\nthere\\'s no doubt in anyone\\'s mind that the 50 cars will be successfully stolen , and the filmmakers blew a perfectly good opportunity to add some suspense to the picture by using the \" rival car thief \" plot line . \\nas it stands , that story line is wrapped up about halfway through the film in a tidy little package . \\nbut if i was making this film , i\\'d have had the rival gang trying to get to the cars before memphis and his crew , thereby making memphis have to improvise . . . \\nthereby adding some meat to the plot . \\nthe finale is essentially just a big car chase , and there just aren\\'t ways to make car chases interesting anymore . \\nit\\'s all been done . \\nthe chase is also shot and edited in that \" jerry bruckheimer action sequence \" kind of way that leaves the audience wondering what specifically is going on in the scene . \\nsure it\\'s a car chase , but what exactly are the particulars of it ? \\nit\\'s very hard to tell . \\nfinally , there\\'s a stunt during this scene that comes close to challenging the \" bus jumping the ramp \" sequence from speed in the \" oh , i don\\'t think so . . . \" \\ndepartment . \\ndespite those minor complaints , gone in sixty seconds is pure summer movie entertainment . \\nit\\'s not thought provoking , but it\\'s shiny , loud and fun . . . \\njust what a summer flick should be . \\n[pg-13] \\n',\n",

\\nyet this is the case in the disney's re-interpretation of the familiar chinese classic . \\nthe end result is spectacular ; mulan is one of disney's best movies ever . \\npersonally , i'm also glad to see the detestable american stereotype of the weak-willed subservient asian woman take a beating : mulan is portrayed as a normal , if spirited , compassionate gal capable of taking the initiative . \\nmulan is more than just eastern graphics and faces combined with westernized pop and disney . \\nkids of any age will like the family themes , and will understand the good guys versus bad guys thing . \\nand adolescent and preteen girls can appreciate the romance factor , while the boys admire the battles . \\nand adults can admire those male/female nuances as well as the interplay between traditional notions of family , honor , and duty with industrial age notions of romantic love , gumption , and questioning . \\nbut even the tiniest details reveal quality . \\nthe movie's art supervisors spent three weeks in china researching the right look : negative spaces , positive detail , period clothing , and graphic designs typical of the time and place . \\ncomputers were used for crowd scenes of up to 30 , 000 people , and a special program called 'attila' was used for a spectacular sequence involving 2000 attacking huns on horseback . \\nand singers osmond and salonga are at the top of their game . \\nbalance is crucial . \\na movie about a chuckling lone dragon played by eddie murphy might not be disney's cup of tea , but if you use the character as a comic sidekick to balance a determined and spirited heroine , then , pow ! \\nthe dream team . \\nby the same token , a tale about a girl in the army might be a sober exercise in filial piety by itself , but toss the dragon in there and you've got enough wahoo individualism for a light hearted disney romp . \\nit's rare that a movie can seamlessly combine elements from both east and west , old and young , male and female into a cohesive and entertaining whole , but mulan hits the universal bullseye . \\nit's movie for any age , creed , gender , or color . \\n\",\n",

              " \"`run lola run' , a german import that gained a stellar reputation at the sundance film festival , is a dazzling and kinetic film that deals with the subjects of fate and chance . \\nfor a berserk and retroactive 81 minutes of non-stop movement , we follow a fiery-haired heroine named lola ( franka potente ) as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the clutches of drug dealers . \\nlola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve 100 , 000 marks in time to save manni ( moritz bleibtreu ) from being killed by the dealer . \\nbut , in something of a pseudo- `groundhog day' approach , director tom tykwer gives lola three separate chances to best navigate her way toward the goal . \\nin these trio of episodes , we gradually learn the unique effects of fate , for even if tiny changes are made in lola's journey , the future can be seriously altered . \\n`run lola run' is an experience like `fight club' or `the matrix' , in that each film takes you through a super-charged wormhole of bending reality in surreal and exciting ways . \\nin addition , all three movies have a visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack . \\n`lola' is no exception , with stylish quick-flash camera work and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy from the get-go . \\ntykwer's world is a landscape of mood and color , with brilliant shades of red and pink ( including lola's fiery hair ) used as effective symbolism throughout . \\nwith it's visual style and mind-blowing pace , `run lola run' is one of the more invigorating movies of the year . \\neven more so when considering the fact it's all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an 81-minute time period . \\nas a heroine , potente does little more than run wildly through the streets ( as the title suggests ) , but she has a certain flair and charisma . \\nher exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a track star . \\nmeanwhile , bleibtreu does an equally fantastic job of bringing the dopey but passionate manni to life . \\nboth actors perform beyond the call of duty . \\nthe dazzling fun comes from predicting what each episode holds in store for lola , and the outcome is ultimately rewarding - several twists and turns are unique and unexpected . \\nthe other characters lola runs into ( both purposely and inadvertently ) include her banker father ( herbert kraup ) and a friendly security guard ( armin rohde ) , but aside from the two leads , no one has more than a few minutes of screen time . \\nadditional stars that couldn't possibly be ignored are cinematographer frank griebe and editor mathilde bonnefroy , who are both responsible for the film's eye-catching visual elegance . \\n`run lola run' is subtitled , so be prepared to meet the challenge of reading the lightning-fast dialogue - occasional sections of it are especially fast . \\nthis is only one of the minor chores involved in watching . \\nthe other is the sense that we never get to really recognize who the real people are in this hyperactive situation . \\nmost are just chess pieces in tykwer's elaborate game of visual presentation , and he never really makes a significant move with any . \\nbut , the average viewer is likely to be so absorbed in the action that few will realize the lack of potency in a few elements of the screenplay . \\na few petty gripes aside , this film is a wild , exhilarating ride that turns maniacally on its wheel of originality . \\nmost people believe foreign films are mainly boring , talky character studies . \\nperhaps `run lola run' will recharge their batteries . \\nnot only does this film offer insight into some intriguing questions of fate and destiny , it also delivers a white-knuckle visual rollercoaster ride of overwhelming audacity . \\nlike how the experience must have been for the persistent title character , `run lola run' is exhausting . \\n\",\n",

              " 'weighed down by tired plot lines and spielberg\\'s reliance on formulas , _saving private ryan_ is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches . \\nthere ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics . \\nspielberg\\'s greatest strength as a director is the polished , formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story . \\nbut for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war ( or the holocaust ) this technique backfires , for it creates coherent , comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size , complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken . \\nin this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films . \\n_saving private ryan_ tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on a \" pr mission \" to pull a young man , ryan ( whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere ) out of combat on the normandy front just after d-day . \\nryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers . \\nthe search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france . \\nthere\\'s no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great war movie . \\nthe equipment , uniforms and weapons are superbly done . \\nthe opening sequence , in which captain miller ( tom hanks ) leads his men onto omaha beach , is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat . \\nanother pleasing aspect of the film is spielberg\\'s brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences , such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers , the banality of death in combat , the routine foul-ups in the execution of the war , and the cynicism of the troops . \\nthe technical side of the film is peerless , as always . \\nthe camera work is magnificent , the pacing perfect , the sets convincing , the directing without flaw . \\nhanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance , which was utterly convincing , and the supporting cast was excellent , though ted danson seems a mite out of place as a paratroop colonel . \\nyet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events . \\nit has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film , or the story fails to convince . \\nthroughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices ( exception : men are shown burning to death with relative frequency ) . \\nfor example , we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground . \\nhere and there men lose limbs ; in one scene miller is pulling a man to safety , there\\'s an explosion , and miller looks back to see he is only pulling half a man . \\nbut the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact . \\nthere are no shoes with only feet in them , no limbs scattered everywhere , no torsos without limbs , no charred corpses , and most importantly , all corpses have heads ( in fairness there are a smattering of wicked head wounds ) . \\nthe relentless dehumanization of the war , in which even corpses failed to retain any indentity , is soft-pedaled in the film . \\nultimately , _saving private ryan_ bows to both hollywood convention and the unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death in war . \\nrather than saying _saving private ryan_ is \" realistic , \" it would be better to describe it as \" having realistic moments . \" \\nanother aspect of the \" hollywoodization \" of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular , the lack of swearing . \\nanyone familiar with the literature on the behavior of the men during the war , such as fussell\\'s superb _wartime : understanding and behavior in the second world war_ ( which has an extensive discussion on swearing ) , knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup . \\n \" who is this private ryan that we have to die for him ? \" \\nasks one infantrymen in the group of eight . \\nrendered in wartime demotic , that should have been expressed as \" who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him ? \" \\nor some variant thereof . \\nconversations should have been literally sprinkled with the \" f \" word , and largely about ( the search for ) food and sex . \\nthis is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an \" r \" rating due to violence , so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it a family film . \\nhowever , the most troubling aspect of the film is the spielbergization of the topic . \\nthe most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg . \\nhe cannot just cede control to the material ; he has to be bigger than it . \\nas if afraid to let the viewer find their own ( perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear ) emotional foothold in the material , spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war a meaning and coherence it never had : the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary ( reminscent of the closing scene from _schindler\\'s list ) , the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close ( every bit as bad as schindler\\'s monologue about how his car , tiepin or ring could have saved another jew ) , quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson , captain miller\\'s last words to private ryan , and an unbelievable storyline in which a prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain . \\nthat particular subplot is so hokey , so predictable , it nigh on ruins the film . \\nnowhere in the film is there a resolute depiction of the meaninglessness , stupidity and waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who actually fought in combat ( imagine if miller had been killed by friendly fire or collateral damage ) . \\nbecause of its failure to mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii , _saving private ryan_ can only pan for small truths in the shallows . \\n . \\n',\n",

\\nyup . \\ndeniro and hoffman are \" stealing \" the election , so to speak , and the movie is more about how they do it -- and the fun they have doing it -- than anything else . ) \\nwag the dog succeeds because it\\'s based one great truth : the american people are stupid . \\nok , maybe it\\'s not \" love thy neighbor as thyself \" or even \" two plus two makes four \" , but a truth nonetheless . \\n ( any average person who thinks that they\\'re really smart about the two things this movie satirizes -- moviemaking and the political process -- is invited , nay , challenged , to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or 48 hours straight watching c-span when the house is in session . ) \\nand because we\\'re so utterly , predictably stupid , hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo , washington knows that we won\\'t notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies -- and deniro\\'s character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won\\'t be able to locate albania on the map . \\nthe beauty of wag the dog is that it isn\\'t a light , meaningless comedy about politics ( like speechless , the michael keaton - geena davis picture ) or from the level of light-hearted politcal satire to near-greatness . \\nnor is it a hard-edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally-deprived , ethically challenged baby-boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house ( like primary colors -- and yes , i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out , thanks for asking ) . \\ninstead , david mamet\\'s script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire . \\nit does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers\\' schemes come off beautifully , and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion . \\ndeniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables , without any of the violent rages . \\nit\\'s all : \" what do i love ? \\nwhat is it that brings me joy ? \\nbaseball , \" minus the savage bloody beating with the bat . \\nhe threatens a lot of people , mind you , but he\\'s doing it in a very nice , polite way . \\nit\\'s a very mellow , restrained performance , which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script . \\nhoffman , on the other hand , is giddy , exuberant and joyous . \\nthis kind of thing is what his character lives for , and he\\'s so excited that he can\\'t even shut up . \\neven on the edge of disaster , he\\'s bright-eyed ( behind oddly tinted sunglasses ) and positive . \\ninsiders note that he\\'s basing his character on some powerful-but-anonymous producer -- which may or may not be true , but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets-put-on-a-show electricity that you figure a producer needs to have . \\nthe best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast . \\nthe characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them , listen to them talk in that wised-up mamet dialogue , get to know them better -- which we don\\'t . \\nanne heche , is dead-bang-on in her portrayal of a political press aide -- cool and composed on the outside , panicked and frenzied on the outside . \\ndenis leary ( one of my favorite actors -- see the ref ) is the \" fad king \" , who handles the profitable \" back-end \" -- t-shirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative , innovative ways to separate a fool from his money . \\nthey could make a whole movie , just about the fad king , and i\\'d go see it . \\nwillie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously , from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song , to the weepy country waltz , to the hilarious \" ballad of the green berets \" parody . \\nwoody harrelson has a brief , but memorable part as the overmedicated \" hero \" of the albanian conflict . \\ncraig t . nelson , as the opposition candidate , and the ever-reliable william h . macy , as a wacky cia agent , are given surprisingly short shrift . \\n ( one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing . ) \\nwag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems : the trivialization of american politics , the role of the press in dumbing down the issues , the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials , the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars -- the list goes on . \\nwe can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens . \\nwag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we don\\'t . \\n',\n",

\" he bursts out every three seconds . \\nwell , patch , that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients . \\nnot everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort . \\nmost of us have to study . \\nand a doctor who really wants to help , but doesn\\'t know a toe from a finger , probably won\\'t be too successful in preventing death . \\noh wait , i almost forgot : the point of doctors is not just to \" prevent death , \" but to \" improve the quality of life ! \" \\nyes ! \\nthat is true ! \\nand you can not do that without studying . \\nyou can not do that without going to medical school . \\nwhat patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe , just maybe , it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later . \\nfollow the rules ?

              " '_in brief : _ this film needs no introduction . \\nif you haven\\'t heard of it , then you must have been up in space on a sabbatical , and if you haven\\'t seen it -- well , i suspect you\\'re in a small minority ! \\nfirst thing\\'s first ? is it all it\\'s hyped up to be ? \\nwell , yes ? and no . \\nit\\'s a good film , and there\\'s a lot to like about it , but it\\'s not without its problems . \\nwhen i saw the first trailer for \" titanic \" , it was when i went to see \" bean \" last summer , i think , my intial reaction was -- ain\\'t that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful , real-life tragedy ? ! \\ni mean , what\\'s happened to hollywood\\'s script-writers , have they run entirely out of new ideas ? \\ngads , whatever next , i asked myself , how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme ? \\ni was not entirely filled with anticipation , but then i wasn\\'t alone in that respect . \\nit\\'s when it came out in the cinema , to rave reviews ( well , mostly ) and anyone who\\'d been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice ! \\ni didn\\'t see the film until several months after its release ( by which time my sister had seen it about four times ! ) , \\nso i went with a slightly more open mind , but i still didn\\'t think i\\'d enjoy it much . \\ndid i ? yes and no . \\nmainly yes , i\\'m happy to say . \\nthe first hour or so was beautifully done , not so much because of the scripting ( i\\'ll talk about that later ? ) but because the re-created ship and sets were stunning to look at , as was cameron\\'s directing , and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the \" human \" aspect of the story , the romance between rose ( kate winslet ) and jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , was enchanting . \\nthe film is told via flashback , with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day ( you knew that , a\\' course ! \\n : - ) ) . \\nwell , it\\'s an often effective device to use in storytelling -- though sometimes it can fall flat . \\ndoes it work here ? \\nin script form it doesn\\'t add all that much to the story . \\nwhat does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart , whose stunning performance is the strongest , most moving of the film . \\nher presence brings a much deeper level of passion , and depth to the story , and though her appearances are relatively brief , the film would have suffered without her . \\nalso impressive are dicaprio and winslet , who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue , and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving . \\nit\\'s an old story , you know -- forbidden love ala romeo and juliet -- but it works , and jack\\'s \" rescuing \" rose ( in both literal and figurative senses ) and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching . \\nin fact , i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot , largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm , energy to the romance . \\nit\\'s engaging , touching and very enjoyable . \\nthere\\'s more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well , simply because you know it\\'s not going to be a happy ending . \\nwhich leads us to the second half of the film . \\nwe all knew it was coming . \\ni\\'m sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it , because as he\\'s stated in interviews , the real thrust of the story ( for him ) was the sinking , and the jack/rose romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film . \\ni think that understates the importance of the romance , as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die . \\nthe iceberg arrives , and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour . \\nand it is an hour . \\nmy goodness , we don\\'t miss a second of that hour ? \\ngratuitous ? well , perhaps not by today\\'s standards , i\\'m sure there\\'s been far worse produced under the banner of \" entertainment \" in other films . \\nbut i certainly wasn\\'t prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be . \\nnot that i\\'d expect the word \" understatement \" to be part of cameron\\'s vocabulary ( he who brought us such , umm , vivid films as \" terminator 2 \" and \" aliens \" ) . \\nis it overdone ? \\ni thought so . \\nunderstatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy . \\nno , no one expected a happy ending , but i didn\\'t quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the film\\'s second half . \\nstill , whether it was overdone and heavy-handed or not , if it was the shock-factor cameron was after it worked , because i was shocked and moved , in fact i spent most of the last hour in tears ! \\nyou really couldn\\'t help but get emotionally involved , whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of rose\\'s overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack , or that jack would rescue rose , or that they would both survive . \\nperhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk , and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface . \\nthe bit where rose lets go of jack\\'s hand , while promising she\\'ll never let go in her heart was particularly heart-wrenching , and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image , to put no fine a point on it . \\ni loved the ending , however , which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half . \\nso , we\\'ve established that the film is powerful and moving , if the last hour was rather excessive . \\nhaven\\'t mentioned the script . \\nplot-wise it\\'s ok , though the jack/rose relationship was beautifully developed , but i\\'ve a feeling that\\'s to the actors credit if anything . \\nas for the dialogue ? well , titanic is set in 1912 . \\nit\\'s a period drama . \\nbut i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned . \\ndid they really use phrases like \" goddamn it ! \" \\nback in the turn of the century ? \\ni doubt it . \\nwould someone talk like this : \" do ya love the guy or what ? \" . \\ni doubt it . \\nis such dialogue as \" i saw the iceberg , and i see it in your eyes now \" not just a bit ? clumsy ? \\nyes it is . \\na little more attention to dialogue would not have gone astray , and cameron himself is to blame ( he wrote the script ) . \\nstick with directing , dude . \\nbut its more than redeemed by the acting , with dicaprio and winslet on fine form , ably supported by a strong cast . \\nstar of the show was gloria stuart , though -- why didn\\'t she win that oscar ? ! \\nafter all , they were throwing oscars at \" titanic \" left , right and centre , but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee . \\ndirecting-wise cameron does a spectacular job . \\nlike i said , his vision was a bit excessive , but at least he directed it well . \\ni haven\\'t even mentioned james horner\\'s beautiful score . \\nutterly heavenly , though when your dad and sister play the soundtrack a lot you do start to get a bit bored with it ! \\n ; - ) \\ni\\'ve finished my rant , which lasted a lot longer than i thought it would ! \\njust leaves a couple of questions ; was it worth all those oscars ? \\nhell , don\\'t talk to me about oscars . \\nbloomin\\' farce . \\nit was deserving in a number of departments , though . \\nlast question ; is it , as some suggest , one of the best films of all-time ? \\nnope , i don\\'t think so . \\nit\\'s certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films i\\'ve ever seen , but i don\\'t think it quite ranks as one of my all-time favourites . \\nand as for the fact they\\'re reportedly making a \" titanic 2 \" ?

              " ' \" mandingo \" has traditionally been seen as one of two things : either a much-needed revisionist look at slavery in the south , or in the words of film critic leonard maltin , \" a trashy potboiler \" that \" appeals only to the s&m crowd . \" \\nactually , i think \" mandingo \" is a strange combination of the two , although it fails on both fronts . \\nit\\'s too trashy to be good drama , but too dramatic to be good trash . \\nthe story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell ( james mason ) and his son , hammond ( perry king ) . \\none day in new orleans , hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede ( heavyweight boxer ken norton ) . \\nalthough the movie never explains it , a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley . \\naccording to the movie , mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves . \\nhammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him . \\nhammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves . \\nmeanwhile , hammond has married his cousin , blanche ( susan george ) , because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild . \\nhammond , however , is happier spending nights with his \" bed wench , \" the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex . \\nit is quickly apparent that hammond , despite his overt racism , is more in love with his bed wench , a sensitive slave girl named ellen ( brenda sykes ) , than he is with blanche . \\nhammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had \" pleasured \" her before he did . \\nof course , it\\'s fine that he\\'s slept with numerous slave girls , but the fact that his wife , a \" white lady , \" had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her . \\nso blanche is usually left lonely and sex-starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen . \\nblanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child . \\nhammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a half-black child ( although it\\'s okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond ) , so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth , and hammond poisons blanche . \\nhammond then finds mede , shoots him twice in the shoulder , and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water . \\nyes , you read right : the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive . \\njudging only by the plot , \" mandingo \" is pure sexploitation . \\nthe main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible , with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society . \\nwhen \" mandingo \" was released in 1975 , it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail ; this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs . \\ndramatically , \" mandingo \" is weak and unfocused , and historically it\\'s mostly confused . \\nif one were to judge history by this film , it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality , not economics . \\nnot once in the film do we see any of the slaves working , except for a few house servants . \\nthe men spend most of the time sitting around , while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner . \\nthere is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves , but \" mandingo\\'s \" overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick ( although there\\'s plenty of violence -- fights , vicious beatings , shootings , and the aforementioned human boiling sequence -- thrown in for good measure ) . \\nsome tried to write off \" mandingo \" as a blaxploitation film , one of a number of quickly-made , low-budget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies , but it\\'s not that easy . \\n \" mandingo \" was studio-financed by paramount pictures , and produced by dino de laurentiis , the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as \" the bible \" ( 1966 ) , the remake of \" king kong \" ( 1976 ) , and the ill-fated \" dune \" ( 1984 ) . \\nthe director was richard fleischer , a veteran who was best known for several special effects-laden action movies including \" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea \" ( 1954 ) and \" fantastic voyage \" ( 1966 ) , as well as such superior suspense films as \" the narrow margin \" ( 1952 ) . \\nthe script , based on the supermarket best-seller by ken ostott ( and the subsequent play by jack kirkland ) , was penned by norman wexler , who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on \" serpico . \" \\njames mason , perry king , and susan george were well-known and respected actors ( mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt ) , and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career . \\nso why is \" mandingo \" so bad ? \\na number of reasons , including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job . \\nwexler\\'s script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive ; it combines stereotyped slave-talk ( \" yessuh , massuh \" ) , stereotyped southern white trash talk ( \" fer whut\\'re you gittin\\' outta bed ? \" ) , and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk ( \" if you see me hang , you gonna know you killed a black brother ! \" ) . \\nfleischer\\'s direction is clumsy , especially during the fight scenes , and all the actors give weak performances , especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable . \\nnevertheless , credit should be given where credit is due . \\ndespite its exploitative nature , \" mandingo \" was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery . \\nuntil then , there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery . \\neven classics such as \" gone with the wind \" ( 1939 ) can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter . \\n \" mandingo \" reassessed the south , and showed that it wasn\\'t all beautiful plantations , green fields , and pretty sunsets . \\nbut all this is constantly undermined by the film\\'s negligible point-of-view -- it claims to see things from the black perspective , but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners . \\nwith a little more maturity and different handling , \" mandingo \" might have been an effective , worthwhile film . \\nwhile it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery , it never deals with them . \\nthe issues the movie brings up are worthwhile , but wexler\\'s script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing . \\nthere is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner , but \" mandingo \" never does it . \\nsteven spielberg touched on that same topic in \" schindler\\'s list \" ( 1993 ) , by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid . \\nthe difference between that film and \" mandingo \" is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair , unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma . \\n \" mandingo \" is satisfied to simply show some skin , and because of that , its \" trashy potboiler \" nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished . \\n',\n",

              " 'melvin van peebles\\' \" sweet sweetback\\'s baadasssss song \" was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement . \\nit was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident . \\nits violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before . \\nin style , content , and how it was conceived and produced , \" sweet sweetback \" was a cinematic revolution , whether or not one agrees with its subject matter . \\nvan peebles , a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france , built \" sweet sweetback \" from the ground up almost entirely by himself . \\nbecause no studio would dare fund such a film , he was forced to raise all the money himself . \\nthe movie ended up costing about $500 , 000 , part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby . \\nvan peebles cut costs by hiring non-union labor and taking on most of the film\\'s responsibilities himself . \\nhe wrote the script , scored the music , edited and directed the film , as well as starred in the central role . \\nhe was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck . \\nfor instance , when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x-rating , van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa , but he also developed a little marketing scheme : he coined the phrases \" rated x by an all-white jury , \" which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film . \\nhe also printed the phrase on tee-shirts which he had no problem selling . \\nthe storyline in \" sweet sweetback \" is deceptively simple . \\nit takes place in los angeles , and van peebles stars as the title character , a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel , and makes money by doing what he does best : having sex . \\none day , he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they\\'re bringing in suspects on a politically-charged case involving murder . \\nhowever , on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mu-mu ( hubert scales ) , who they proceed to beat viciously . \\nacting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation , sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death . \\nthe rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico . \\nalthough the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film , this plot allows van peebles\\' camera to roam the darker side of l . a . - the ghettos , alleys , and back-street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked . \\nvan peebles\\' entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored . \\nat the beginning of \" sweet sweetback , \" he offers this epigraph , which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news : \" sire , these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented , but a hymn from the mouth of reality . . . \" \\nvan peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality , not of exaggeration . \\nof course , with today\\'s abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner-city life , as well as films by spike lee , john singleton , and the hughes brothers , \" sweet sweetback \" doesn\\'t seem all that revolutionary . \\nit is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made . \\nat that time , \" sweet sweetback \" was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it . \\ndistributors were petrified of a film that , in van peebles\\' words , gave the black audience \" a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out - about rising out of the mud and kicking ass . \" \\nof course , once it caught on , it caught on big . \\n \" sweet sweetback \" is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era , although van peebles disassociates \" sweetback \" from other movies like \" shaft \" ( 1972 ) and \" the mack \" ( 1973 ) , because those were financed by big hollywood studios . \\n \" sweet sweetback \" is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers . \\nhowever , even if when viewed from an african-american perspective , \" sweet sweetback \" is certainly not without its controversies . \\nwhen it was first released , an article was published in \" ebony \" magazine denouncing the film , while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it . \\nthere have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all - beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of . \\nothers have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film ; he has no political motivations , and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs , but in personal and selfish motives . \\nstill others point to the clich ? black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex , illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm . \\nnevertheless , a movie like \" sweet sweetback \" cannot be made without conflicting points of view . \\nit is a revolutionary movie not because it\\'s about one man\\'s defiance , but because it put front-and-center black issues that had never been dealt with before . \\nuntil that point , american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain , and with the exception of sidney poitier , all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites . \\nthe fact that \" sweet sweetback \" was a movie by black about blacks , was something new ( in the opening credits , van peebles lists the starring actors as simply \" the black community \" ) . \\nvan peebles tells an interesting story that goes a long way toward defining the difference between \" sweet sweetback \" and all movies that had come before it . \\nwhen the movie first opened , he saw it in a theater next to an older woman . \\nnear the end of the film , when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert , she kept saying to herself , \" oh lord , let him die . \\ndon\\'t let them kill him . \\nlet him die on his own . \" \\nit was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any african-american in a movie who rebelled against white authority , that she couldn\\'t even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape . \\nand , of course , sweetback does escape , and the screen fills with the message : \" watch out ! \\na baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues . \" \\nbeyond the political aspects , \" sweet sweetback \" is an entertaining picture , which van peebles always intended it to be . \\nhe squeezed every drop out of his limited budget , and produced a film that , although dated now , was technically fantastic at the time . \\nhe shot in rough , documentary-like fashion , while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him . \\nhe makes good use of older techniques like split screens , freeze frames , reversed color schemes , and overlapping images . \\nthe only time the film ever looks bad is during the night sequences , because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment . \\nwatching \" sweet sweetback \" more than twenty-five years after its initial release , one realizes that it still has bite . \\narguments can be made that race relations in the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies , but there are still problems that are reflected in this film . \\nbut there is more to the film than its racial aspect . \\nthe legacy of \" sweet sweetback\\'s baadasssss song \" is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the african-american perspective , but more importantly , the work of every artist who has fought to fund and produce that which is important to him . \\n',\n",

\\nthe race would have been even more exciting without the distraction . \\nthis aspect , coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me . \\ni suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer , but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all ? \\ndidn\\'t millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in 1977 over and over again ? \\ndidn\\'t the action figures still sell like hotcakes ? \\nof course they did , and it\\'s only poor judgment that allows the most-eagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults . \\none aspect that will appeal broadly , however , is the use of special effects . \\nthe people at lucas\\'s industrial light and magic , the world\\'s premiere effects house , outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computer-generated images and real-life footage . \\nsome of the scenes have to be seen to be believed , especially the shots of a land battle between the federation\\'s robot army and jar jar\\'s countrymen . \\nthe space battles are also impressive , although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer . \\nthis , however , is a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today . \\njohn williams is back , of course , providing a score for the film as only he can . \\nhis music is pervasive throughout , as rousing and as dramatic as ever , always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately . \\nsince this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nine-episode story ( star wars , the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four , five and six , respectively ) , the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already , in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar . \\nas a result , attention to history and characterization was spread a little thin . \\nit would have been nice to get more in depth with yoda and obi-wan , for example , but given the fact that there were several new characters to cover , it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films . \\none of the new characters is darth maul , hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this film\\'s release . \\nin spite of the hype , darth maul is a character which almost didn\\'t have to be in the film , his role is so insignificant . \\nhe has maybe three spoken lines ( believe it or not , a second actor voices the character ) and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean . \\nwith that working against him , he never has a chance at being interesting and instead ends up an utter disappointment . \\nlucas seems to have wanted to develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe , something which has been prominent throughout . \\nhowever , he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible , offering an easy out for story-writing and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth with a real-life connection . \\noddly , while trying to capitalize on spirituality , lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little force-loving parasites in your body\\'s cells . \\nthis only serves to de-mystify the workings of the force a few notches by offering a scientific connection . \\ndon\\'t let me mislead you too far . \\nthe phantom menace , by most standards , is a good film . \\nit contains a lot of visual treats , sets the stage for an epic story , gives us a bit of excitement here and there , and even allows us to revisit some of our old friends . \\nit\\'s just that when held up to it\\'s predecessors ( and to not do so would be unrealistic ) , this film simply pales . \\n',\n",

any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer , which would then engage in a real-time dialog with the aliens , exchanging information and technologies , and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned . \\nabout thirty-five years ago , the bbc contracted with astronomer/writer fred hoyle and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a mini-series called a for andromeda . \\nafa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission , the construction of a huge computer , the computer\\'s analysis of life on earth , and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication . \\nshe was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the then-unknown julie christie . \\naudience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel , andromeda breakthrough , which played to equally high ratings . \\ndennis feldman , whose previous credits include the golden child , has never been noted for coherent , well-structured movie scripts ; they start out great , and then disintegrate into a morass of chase and action , mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl . \\nfeldman writes good scenes , but has no idea how to tell a story or write a movie , even with a previous version to use as a model . \\nnow , in species , we have a mundane retread of the andromeda plotline , derailed by a preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady and further ruined by a mediocre attempt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter , gore , and chases . \\nspecies features ben kingsley , who is completely wasted in a badly-written portrayal of a feebly amoral scientist . \\nforest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script . \\nthe species story is relatively simple ;

forrest whitaker is a convenient empath/psychic , just as though the u . s . government actually had such people on call . \\nneither is able to do much with the writing and directing provided . \\nwhitaker\\'s role seems to be aimed at making whitaker a male copy of star trek : the next generation\\'s \" counselor cleavage . \" \\nthe other members of the strike team are played by marg helgenberger and alfred molina . \\nkingsley and whitaker are both consummate professionals , too good to not work to the best of their abilities ; but the performances donaldson elicited from the rest of the cast are disappointing and bland , and it is apparent that the direction was a bit weak . \\nh . r . giger\\'s design for the main form of the alien creature is actually a bit boring when we finally get to see it , although previous digital effects were done quite smoothly . \\nthe main fault of species is lack of originality ; it starts out with a wonderful , albeit borrowed , premise , and then doesn\\'t live up to it . \\nall we get are chase scenes and a few nice sex scenes , with a few monsters tossed in . \\nthere is no buildup of tension and suspense , no climax worthy of the name ;

              " 'bill condon\\'s \" gods and monsters \" is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale ( ian mckellan ) , who made the horror classics \" frankenstein \" and \" bride of frankenstein . \" \\nsince i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film , there is no way to know how accurate the film is , but i suspect that much of it only came from whale\\'s inner fantasies and hallucinations . \\nwhale , who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures , decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him . \\nas the film tells it , during the end of his life , whale , at his large home in l . a . , became infatuated with the tall , handsome , and much younger man , clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) , who was working as the gardener at his home . \\njames whale , we learn quickly was , what many people refer to him as in the film , \" a dirty old man . \" \\nin one of the opening scenes , a young film enthusiast visits whale\\'s home to interview him and whale agrees , on one condition : for every question he answers , the young man must take off an article of clothing . \\nbecause of this episode , we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting , later making the excuse that his bright , white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off . \\nclayon agrees , and doesn\\'t really think much of this , much to the warnings of his friends , becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past . \\ncertainly , the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall , since whale starts to grow a deep love for this young man , even though boone is not gay , and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life , as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis . \\n \" gods and monsters \" is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast , due to his sexual preference , and never got the recognition he would have liked , since he longed to be referred to as a \" motion picture director , \" rather than a \" horror director . \" \\nand in one heartbreaking scene , he attends a party with boone being his guest , held by director george cuckor , and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore . \\nit is evident that whale\\'s first love in his life was making movies , and when his career ultimately fell apart , so did his passion in life . \\nas played brilliantly by ian mckellen , james whale comes off as a sad , but dignified man , and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others , just as long as he knew he was being true to himself . \\nhe never hid the fact that he was gay , however , even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession , and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a great person . \\nthrough the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone , boone , of course , only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to , while it means so much more to whale , who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life . \\nalthough boone is only in a dead-end job as a gardener of people\\'s homes , whale views him as the ideal man , not only one that is good-looking , even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings , but one that will actually listen to him . \\nsince whale lives with only his loyal , but disapproving maid ( touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave ) , it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world , and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor . \\nalthough an extremely fine and mature picture , a few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness . \\nit is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments , but it is a little thin , and the structuring of the \" on-again-off-again \" friendship at the film\\'s center is fairly predictable . \\nwe know early on where these two characters are headed , and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds . \\nin lesser hands , this set-up might have felt too calculated , but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this . \\nalso , a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar ( effectively played by lolita davidovich ) , but abruptly dropped and never brought up again . \\nif the film was not going to follow up on this side story , then it , perhaps , should have been taken out altogether . \\n \" gods and monsters \" is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture , impressively directed by bill condon , who , i sense , relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone . \\nthe film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end . \\nwalking away from \" gods and monsters , \" it was ian mckellen\\'s marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me , and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably . \\nit is a sad testament when a person\\'s true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them , based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life , which , ironically

              " 'historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s . \\nfor many critics , scholars and , most importantly , film producers , it was a thing of the past - something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black-and-white television and non-cgi special effects . \\nbut in 1995 , same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago , there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor , producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre . \\nand , same as in the case of dances with wolves , he was awarded for his effort with \" oscars \" . \\nthe name of the film was braveheart , and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson . \\nthe plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace ( 1272 - 1305 ) . \\nin his time , english king edward i \" longshanks \" ( played by patrick mcgoohan ) has almost completely subdued entire british isles , including scotland , whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by \" ius primae noctis \" and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights . \\nalthough english had killed his father many years ago , young scottish commoner william wallace ( played by mel gibson ) doesn\\'t care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron ( played by catherine maccormack ) . \\nmurron\\'s death changes that and wallace takes arms and , together with small but dedicated band of followers , begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country . \\nthrough time , more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace\\'s rag-tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge . \\nbut the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves , especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce ( played by angus macfadyen ) , who wouldn\\'t like to have a simple commoner as a national leader . \\nbraveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson , so it wouldn\\'t be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann . \\nhowever , even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre . \\nthe most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism . \\nwhile older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale-like vision of picturesque castles , splendid costumes and knights in shining armour , gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard , short and brutish . \\nthis general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle , where hand-to-hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details , never seen since verhoeven\\'s ultra-naturalistic flesh & blood . \\ncompared with this naturalistic approach , most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays . \\nbraveheart also employs humour at the right places , not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences , but also to underline its down-to-earth atmosphere , so different from previous historical epics . \\nwhat makes braveheart \" larger than life \" is his protagonist . \\nmel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and , as a result , character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero . \\nwallace is more than superior to his enemies , both physically and mentally , yet he is able to show his sensitive , more vulnerable side . \\nnaturally , when the character is based on epic poems , most of historical accuracy is going down the drain ( which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s ) . \\nhowever , even those who don\\'t particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace , especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel ( played by sophie marceau ) and make her a child . \\nbecause of that the disbelief is hardly suspended , and final scenes aren\\'t as effective as they should be . \\nmel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful , and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors . \\nmost memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan , whose cold , calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema . \\nbrendan gleeson ( who would later become famous for his role in boorman\\'s general ) is also very good as wallace\\'s trusted companion , as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy-stricken king john balliol . \\ndavid o\\'harra is very entertaining as wallace\\'s irish ally , and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience-stricken character of robert the bruce . \\nwomen in this film have rather thankless roles , especially marceau as one-dimensional french princess . \\ncatherine mccormack as wallace\\'s wife was more interesting , but she was eliminated from the picture early on . \\nfrom the technical point of view , the film is also very good . \\nphotography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen . \\non the other hand , the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern-day instruments for period piece set in medieval times . \\nalthough mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike , braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism . \\nthe main reason for that was the fact that gibson , among many historical facts , chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of \" longshank \" \\'s son prince edward ( played by peter hanly ) . \\nhe is not only presented as a villain , but also as one of the less competent in villain\\'s camp - and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in \" politically correct \" hollywood . \\nto make things even more obvious , good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward - rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives\\' common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals . \\nhowever , although the message of this film might look right-wing , it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century . \\naccording to that ideology , oppressed classes ( workers , peasants ) are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and , as such , they are more radical , less willing to make compromises and more efficient ; on the other hand , privileged classes ( aristocracy , bourgeoisie ) are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges . \\nthis marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety . \\nin the end , whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic , braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre . \\n',\n",

              " 'in the interest of being generous , i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black . \\nsir anthony hopkins , playing a super-rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner . \\nhis oldest daughter ( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing ) , who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake . \\nthe daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes . \\nhopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts . \\nwhichever one you like , dear , he says . \\nand the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she cries . \\ni liked that scene for two reasons . \\nfirst , the cakes looked really cool . \\nsecond , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act . \\nmeet joe black is chock-full of odd performances , people doing things for no discernible reason at all , and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot . \\nit\\'s easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani , but it\\'s even easier to sleep right through it ( two people on my row managed it quite nicely ) . \\nthe difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess . \\ni know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was a comedy . \\ncase in point : everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie . \\nhowever , the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani . \\n ( it\\'s not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death , but it makes a certain kind of sense . ) \\nit shouldn\\'t take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr . pitt . \\nand indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished . \\nwell , when that happened , the audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous . \\nso , if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing-room humor are funny , i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately . \\nanyway , the deceased lawyer\\'s body , no worse the wear from its massive injuries , is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role . \\nthe idea is that death ( given the pen name of joe black , so as not to disturb others ) wants to take a holiday and experience the world . \\nif this weren\\'t hollywood , we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death , but since it is , we get scene after scene of fish-out-of-water humor , just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who\\'s wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn\\'t know how to act in our society . \\nit also doesn\\'t help that the character of death is written so inconsistently . \\nhe claims to be on vacation , but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani ( just try to get your travel agent to book that one ) . \\nhe speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois . \\nhe knows everything about some characters , nothing about others . \\nand as played by brad pitt , he\\'s not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing , he\\'s just there . \\nit\\'s as if someone told pitt , \" never mind about acting in this picture , son , just stand there and look pretty . \" \\nit\\'s as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie . \\ni\\'ve used the phrase \" angel of death \" in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt\\'s performance with this year\\'s best angel performance , nicolas cage\\'s in city of angels . \\nwhere pitt is cold and unfeeling , cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows . \\nwhere cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man , pitt is aloof and arrogant . \\ncage struck instant chemical sparks with co-star meg ryan , where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani\\'s character is so shallow that she can\\'t see beyond pitt\\'s good looks . \\nthe movie\\'s other top name is a much better actor , but that doesn\\'t save meet joe black . \\nsir anthony hopkins isn\\'t given much better material to work with , unfortunately . \\nhe plays one of these good-hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood . \\n ( one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins\\'s character more realistically evil . ) \\nhopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker , but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world . \\nof course , no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder . \\nbut i have to wonder ( and in this movie , you have a very long time to wonder ) how you or i would act in a similar situation , especially if you or i were a multimillionaire . \\nhopkins pretty much goes to the office -- and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation . \\nfans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated , i\\'m sure . \\ni stayed awake all the way through meet joe black , and i\\'m asking myself why . \\nmovies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest , which is what i\\'m going to do now . \\ngo spend time with your family , go volunteer for a local charity , heck , go take a nap . \\ndon\\'t go see meet joe black , because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death . \\n-- curtis edmonds \\n \" no children have ever meddled with the republican party and lived to tell about it . \" \\n-- sideshow bob \\n',\n",

so instead , she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar , bilal ( said taghmaoui ) . \\nhe becomes her lover , taking the place of her husband as a father figure for the girls . \\nthe girls readily accept him , and there is no big-to-do made about their openly sexual relationship , but the girls really don't know what to make of the relationship . \\nit especially bothers bea , who is embarrassed by her mother's loose attitude and wants to go home . \\nthings go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village . \\nit seems only that bilal's charm is matched by his shiftlessness , as he has a wife who still lives there . \\nthis scene didn't make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation , unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people , also . \\nbut i doubt that . \\nthe family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next , as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel . \\nlucy takes it all in stride and has a good disposition for travel , while bea just wants to go to a school and learn something and be a 'normal' girl . \\nthe beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet , as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes , expansive views , illustrious mosques , and grand sunsets . \\nkate enacts the feel of what it was like to be a westerner , living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences , as many a drop-out reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose . \\nthe background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane , provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film . \\nthe only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn , a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves . \\nthe family's travel , which is on the edge , has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting ; but , when she gets up , all there is , is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her . \\nthat marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her , is starting to wear thin in her thoughts . \\nit will dawn on her , when bea takes ill , as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her , whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence . \\nhe is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him . \\nthe new guru is grounded in reality , something she is not grounded in , and seems to tell her what she couldn't comprehend from anyone else , even comforting her , by telling her that her tears are memories- a gift from god . \\nthe film's weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor ( she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation ) and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia . \\nthe storyline about a helpless single parent , detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same baby-boom generation had during their trip to morocco , who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism , a teaching that has a lot to offer its followers , contrary to the impression the film might give , seemed to pass her by . \\nher knowledge of that trip is only surface deep , at best . \\nshe perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along , smoking some hashish , and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn't have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey . \\nafter all , the mystical trip is the journey . \\nthe film's strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are , and no one is that good or that bad , or judged too harshly for their shortcomings . \\nbilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity . \\nthe little girls are precocious but they are lovable . \\njulia , the cornerstone the film is built on , is a mother who cares about the children but doesn't know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them . \\nshe was trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london , she has another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where she's at . \\nthis is a very freudian way to look at things , as this sudden realization , that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey , at least , for the time being . \\nand , after all is said and done , who's to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences , just like she probably was ! \\n\",\n",

              " 'if you\\'re going to make a two-hour hollywood in-joke , why bother releasing it to the general public ? \\nif you\\'re going to create a film that will appeal primarily to big-name actors and people who know woody allen , then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters ? \\nwhile watching celebrity , i realized that allen had only marginal interest in creating a story about real people . \\nwhat he really wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited self-deprecation . \\ncelebrity is yet another film in which allen tells a story about himself , living in a world that he\\'s familiar with , dealing with people like the ones he actually knows . \\nallen recruited poor kenneth branagh to bumble through this picture , in an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like the film more . \\nbranagh plays lee simon , a journalist-turned-screenwriter who divorces his wife , robin ( judy davis ) , shacks up with some hot women ( famke janssen , charlize theron , winona ryder ) , and goes about trying to get big stars ( melanie griffith , leonardo dicaprio ) to read his script about an armored car robbery . \\nthe usual elements of recent allen films are all here , including the sexual insecurity of the main character , lots of self-loathing women , and a tiring continuum of episodes that are only loosely related to one another . \\nunless you work in the film industry or know woody allen personally , it\\'s not likely that you\\'ll find a whole lot of interest in celebrity . \\naside from all the in-jokes , the story falls far short of compelling , and the characters are all empty and lifeless . \\nbranagh proves once again that he\\'s a superb performer , nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly . \\nthe problem is that he\\'s the same character allen always plays , a character who\\'s getting more than a little dull to watch . \\ni mean , come on , how many times have you seen this guy ? \\n-- he hates his work , and he can\\'t be satisfied by any one woman , and , at the end of the movie , nothing has been solved . \\nhe brings all of his problems upon himself ( crashing his car because he\\'s receiving fellatio , and other such stunts ) , so it\\'s pretty hard to care about him . \\nin addition , isn\\'t allen capable of creating characters who aren\\'t just like him ? \\ni know he is , but he didn\\'t do it in celebrity . \\nthe vacant emotional attachment with the main character is not recaptured in the supporting performances . \\ndavis , playing the same woman with low self-esteem that she played in deconstructing harry , has a few touching moments , but ends up the same despicable celebrity-type that fills the rest of the movie . \\nsome of the actresses are saved because of their beauty -- theron and ryder , especially -- but they\\'re not likable people . \\nonly famke janssen , as a book editor interested in simon\\'s new novel , has any life . \\nthe men in the picture don\\'t do much better -- joe mantegna is pretty dull as the man who remarries robin , while dicaprio , as a christian slater/johnny depp-type spoiled young actor , is funny but disengaging . \\nwhat\\'s really insulting about celebrity is how dull and standard its \" themes \" are . \\nallen seems to think that he\\'s making an insightful movie about the way \" normal \" people look at celebrities . \\nthe main problem with this is that the character with whom we\\'re supposed to identify , simon , is not a \" normal \" guy -- he\\'s just as entrenched in the hollywood image as the rest of the characters . \\nthe other problem is that the image we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening than the view the media gives us -- none of them register as realistic , interesting characters ; they mostly just function as set pieces for boring dialogue . \\nin addition , allen decides he needs a scene in which the theme is expressed explicitly ( robin , in this scene , says something like , \" it\\'s interesting to see the way we all look at the people we celebrate ! \" ) . \\ncelebrity is arguably allen\\'s biggest misfire to date . \\nit does have a few good scenes -- theron\\'s super-orgasmic model character is kind of funny , and the last scene might have been moving had the rest of the film shown us a character or two . \\nbut celebrity is a failure at the core , unless allen\\'s point was to make a self-indulgent movie about himself and his friends . \\nif he wanted to make his audience feel like they were on the outside of a big joke , then he succeeded in that . \\ni , for one , don\\'t enjoy feeling like an outsider . \\n',\n",
              " 'i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files . \\nfirst , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie . \\nthe producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable . \\nyou have to reach for a larger audience . \\ntherefore , the movie is quite user-friendly . \\naltough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange . \\nbut fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on . \\nyou will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera . \\nin any case , the answer is no . \\ni am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium . \\nhowever , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie\\'s opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie . \\ni taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new . \\neverything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others . \\ni know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie . \\nwarning : major spoilers follow ! \\nplease do not read , to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird \" hummm \" sound is all about . \\nyou have been warned . \\nthe x-files is what a summer should be . \\nexciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances . \\nthis is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank . \\nfrom start to finish , this movie does not let go of you . \\nwhen i compare it with last summer\\'s movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon . \\nthis flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes . \\nin fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue . \\nyou might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! \\nthe last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid . \\nyou know , when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? \\nso yeah , the x-files is scary . \\nand guess what ? \\nyou never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster . \\ndo not think that the x-files is a monster movie . \\nin fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total . \\nno , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series . \\nscully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time . \\nshe has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much . \\nno , this is mulder\\'s time in the spotlight . \\nby now , you have heard of the scene where mulder \" showers \" independence day . \\nif you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let\\'s just say that due to recent events mulder should be \" showering \" godzilla instead . \\nto those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there . . . who \\ncares ! ? \\nif he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ? \\nthe dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous . \\nthe camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill . \\nthe script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose . \\nif you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i cannot stress this enough , pay attention ! ! ! \\nunlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects . \\nmiss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense . \\nalso , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies . . . don\\'t ! \\nthe person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation . \\nthere is no time to take a breather between scenes because , again unlike most summer movies ( godzilla anybody ? \\n ) the x-files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots , every scene is crucial and serves a purpose . \\nwho needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a \" big emotional scene \" between godzilla attacks ? \\nso far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i\\'d recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose . \\nbut the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie , the x-files is . \\nwhat more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ? \\ncool effects ? \\nit\\'s good some . \\npulse pounding ? \\nhell yes ! \\nstrangely enough , i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non-fans will have a good time . \\nit does not provide answers to the show\\'s many questions , the status quo remains nearly the same and , no , mulder and scully do not get together . \\nrating : four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer , several jump right out of your seat thrills , many \" whoah , i never saw that one coming ! \" \\nmoments , four \" holy shit , where the hell did that come from \" and one heck of an ending . \\nyou may wonder where this movie lost half a star . \\nwell , i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck , the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop . \\nit\\'s pretty obvious the film\\'s makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time , but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving . \\n',\n",

              " \"this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney's live- action george of the jungle . \\ntarzan and the lost city , the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough's legendary hero to the big screen , is one of the most inept and ill-timed of any tarzan adventure so far . \\nbadly conceived and poorly executed , tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves . \\ni have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan ; it's not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie . \\nfurthermore , it's even more curious that this film is rated pg , which , by definition , rules out any sex or explicit violence . \\nand , while i'm not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story , tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production . \\nof course , no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city , since the film's troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line . \\nimagine george of the jungle stripped of all ( intentional ) humor , and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like . \\nwith its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences , the film barely registers a pulse . \\nanyone in search of a relatively entertaining , family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book , which uses the same basic elements to much better effect . \\nthe only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery ( which , unfortunately , includes the two lead actors ) . \\nthe film doesn't attempt to re-tell the origin story ? the thinking is that it has been done often enough . \\ninstead , tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a . k . a . john clayton a . k . a . tarzan the ape man ( casper van dien ) several days before his marriage to lady jane porter ( jane march ) . \\nhe is living happily in england , enjoying the benefits of being a land-owning noble . \\nmeanwhile , in central africa , the dastardly nigel ravens ( steven waddington ) , a self-proclaimed scholar and explorer , believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar , which he calls the cradle of civilization . \\non the way there , he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things , like burning native villages , to earn the wrath of the locals . \\none shaman , determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal , sends a mystical message to tarzan for help . \\nwith lady jane following close behind , he returns to the jungle where he was born . \\nits patently obvious that casper van dien ( one of the pretty-boy heroes of starship troopers ) was not hired on the basis of his acting ability . \\nwith his plastic facial expressions , monotone voice , and complete inability to make convincing animal noises , his range rivals that of steven seagal . \\nhis pecs , however , are impressive , and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off . \\njane march , on the other hand , has to keep her shirt on , which may be a first for her . \\nsome six years ago , march give a solid performance in jean jacques annaud's steamy the lover . \\nsince then , she made the career-killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night , which exploited her every acting defiency . \\ntarzan continues this trend . \\nmarch may be attractive , but , at least judging by this performance , she can't act . \\nmeanwhile , steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy . \\ninstead , he turns out to be little more than a nuisance . \\nthe story line is pure formula , which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies . \\nthe problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless . \\nthe romantic elements are all contrived ? in fact , lady jane's presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance . \\nthe special effects are truly bottom-of-the-barrel ( including some laughably bad men in ape costumes ? apparently , animatronics were too expensive for this production ) . \\nand , of course , as with all jungle movies , there are the obligatory cute animals . \\nover the years , the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material . \\nthe most famous ape man was johnny weismuller , but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part ( including gordon scott , who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role ) . \\nweismuller made 12 tarzan features ; van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number . \\nand , having seen tarzan and the lost city , i would argue that the movie-going public would have been well served if he had missed by 12 . \\n\",\n",

\" \\nshe argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public , questioning what is good or evil in society , something that bad science has completely ignored . \\ngeoffrey , impatient to get ahead with his research , feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him with the three chimps he needs to experiment on , as he contacts one of the company\\'s higher ups to argue his case , but decides he can\\'t wait any longer for their help , so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester , the gorgeous pet dog of frances , a dog that means so much to her and her family because he saved her life . \\nwhile out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car , he is spotted by alex and one of his co-workers , and nervously invites them to dinner with his wife , afraid that alex will spot what he is doing , as he rushes away from the area . \\nin the dinner scene that was , unfortunately , flatly done , but was nevertheless the heart of the film , as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat , a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything . \\nthe scientists engage in a rational argument , highlighting their different points of view , while lillian reacts in an emotional way , siding mostly with david\\'s view but coming at it from a much different angle . \\nit was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies . \\nthat the director\\'s point of view is absolutely right , is beside the point . \\nthe point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one-dimensional characters . \\ngeoffrey was likened to a hideous monster , alex vine was likened to his last name , the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability , while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art , the inspiration for goodness and beauty . \\nalex has been spending a lot of time together with lillian , as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other , but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them , lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alex\\'s apartment . \\ngeoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy , and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working , as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him . \\nthe relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely . \\nthe dog is discovered by alex and her in a deplorable state after geoffrey is seen by them electrically shocking it , and mercifully the dog dies . \\nthe only thing left for her to do is walk out of the marriage , but she also fails to respond to david\\'s loving gesture for her to stay with him , instead opting to head back to the city . \\nthe farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes into the scientist\\'s lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of a phone conversation with one of the higher-ups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way . \\nwhat is progress ? \\nwhat can one expect out of life ? \\nis the small farmer about to become extinct ? \\nthe answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art , which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way . \\nthat this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions , leaving no room for deeper arguments , is the shame of this decent and smart film , that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white . \\nno telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in ; it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic . \\nthere is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me , as i don\\'t like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically . \\nthat is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit , that inspite of its shortcomings , it was worth seeing because of its visual statements , though they were also not too subtle , they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently , of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them , and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference . \\nthe stakes in this ecological struggle are that high . \\nperhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film , was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene . \\nit was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picasso\\'s guernica had for him . \\nboth artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world , and represented this unspoken pain on the faces of the animals so that anyone who cares to really see what is going on , will not mistake which side of the fence he or she should be on . \\nthe pain that lillian feels , as she forgets about her desires to raise a family , and she stares at her painting of the cow and the song , \" make the world go away \" blares out from the background , after she has learned that frances\\' beautiful and loving dog has been brutalized by her monster of a husband , all in the name of science , had a raw power to it that personalizes the dangers of bad science . \\nperhaps , the most pertinent question the film asks , requires an answer that must be resolved by the farmers and the consumers who are most caught in the changing world and its new way of doing business , as the question becomes , can science be happily married with art ?

) , comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei-hong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng . \\nand so it goes . \\nand the plot thickens later on , such as when fei-hong\\'s girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival , or when fei-hong and the thief , now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners , are attacked en masse ( another grand kung-fu movie tradition ) , but i think i\\'ve already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves . \\nlet\\'s move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies . . . the \\naction . \\nthere\\'s plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie . . . of \\ncourse , in a kung fu film , that\\'s to be expected . \\nhowever , this isn\\'t just another kung fu movie ; this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography , and jackie chan is a genius . \\nthe primary martial arts \" style \" featured in the film is drunken boxing , a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk . \\nfurther , for the purposes of this film at least , drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated . . . but \\nthere\\'s a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor . \\nunder normal circumstances , the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid , but jackie pulls it off with flair . \\nthe kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper , so i\\'ll just say that the fights--especially the big climactic fight at the end--in themselves make the movie worth watching . \\nanother thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work . \\neven without motor vehicles ( well , not counting a train ) , there are some remarkable stunts in this film . \\namong other things , jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals ( not once , but at _least_ twice , if you count the outtake shown during the credits ) . \\n ( quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database . ) \\nunlike in american films , these stunts are _not_ faked . \\ndrunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene , including jackie , ti lung ( \" a better tomorrow \" 1 & 2 ) , and anita mui ( the \" heroic trio \" series , \" rumble in the bronx \" ) . \\nthe performances are first-rate , especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film . \\nthe scene where fei-hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei-hong\\'s father\\'s back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious , as is the scene where fei-hong\\'s mother , having just revealed that she is pregnant , is threatening to hurt herself ( in order to draw her husband\\'s anger away from fei-hong ) . \\njackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years , and he\\'s in fine form all through drunken master ii . \\nas far as cinematography is concerned , it certainly works for this film . \\nit\\'s nothing spectacular , but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s . \\nthe picture is crisp and clear . \\none thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that , at least in the copy i have , the screen was wider than any film i\\'ve ever seen on videotape before--almost a whole 1/3 of the screen was blocked out above and below . \\n ( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can . ) \\nit will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan-and-scanned for american video release . \\ndrunken master ii shows the full potential of \" period piece \" kung fu movies , and it\\'s good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies . \\nthe plot does meander a bit , but that\\'s to be expected in this type of film . \\nif you like this kind of movie , you\\'ll love this movie , and if not , well , give it a chance anyway . \\nif nothing else , the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the price of admission or rental . \\n',\n",

\\nabsolutely none . \\nthey were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie . \\nthen we have the actors . \\nlili taylor has never been one of my favorites . \\nand when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in , she comes in around the average or slightly below mark . \\ni have no idea why liam neeson took this role . \\nhe basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus . \\nhis character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him . \\ni have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman . \\nzeta-jones was cast because she is too hot for words . \\nthe fact that her character is bi-sexual is just icing on the cake . \\nall catherine has to do in this movie is look good . \\nfortunately that is something she does very well . \\nwhile she does have a fairly good size part , it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie was as eye-candy . \\nit\\'s too bad someone of her talents wasted them here . \\nany random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role . \\nthe haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999\\'s horror movies , the blair witch project . \\nthe haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget , while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares . \\nboth prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film . \\nif the story sucks , it\\'s all downhill from there . \\nmy advice ? \\nif you are looking for special effects , go rent star wars . \\nif it\\'s scares you want , rent halloween . \\neither way , it\\'s probably in your best interests to skip the haunting . \\n',\n",
              " 'with the sudden liberal emergence of personal privacy abounding in the news lately , what with that whole clinton thing going on ( you know , 100 million bucks to discover the president got boinked by an intern - oh , please , government , waste my taxes just a bit more , would you ? ) , \\nit\\'s about time tony scott helmed the newest action pic disguised as an important if not slightly ignorant social statement . \\nwith this and \" crimson tide , \" he\\'s created two successfully chilly films that are interesting , exciting , even pretty smart , but never totally riveting as cinema , and the problem i think with each of these films is that each film is too obsessed with its message to ever be really satisfying , and too obsessed with looking all cutting edge to ever be totally smart . \\nthat film dealt with a civil war inside a nuclear submarine over whether or not to follow rules or question them , and was appropriately scary and all , but never totally thrilling or overly brilliant . \\n \" enemy of the state \" is the same way : it\\'s engrossing for its entire running time , and it\\'s scary the way that it shows a man\\'s decent into kafkaism , but it\\'s too technical . \\nit\\'s too cold and not as fascinating or exciting as it could be . \\nit casts will smith , one of the better big budget leading men in movies these days because he\\'s charming and witty and never uninteresting , and hopes that his charisma can make up for his character not being well developed enough to really be a person . \\ni hate to do this , but last year\\'s film \" the game \" got it damn perfect : it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human being , a man who is cold and has cut off everyone from his life , and then pulls everything he thought he had as a security blanket away from him and watched what happened . \\nthe result was not only a film that was exciting and chilling , but also the best mindfuck of the entire year . \\nnot that i want every kafkaesque film to be \" the game \" ( this year\\'s \" the spanish prisoner \" succeeds with less thrills and chills ) , but it should be an example of what works and what doesn\\'t . \\nwill smith\\'s character is , frankly , too perfect , at least too movie perfect . \\nhe had an affair with another woman ( lisa bonet , ha ha ) , but his relationship with his wife ( regina king ) is basically fine regardless . \\nhe has a kid , and he\\'s raking in money as a lawyer , albeit a very good and reasonably moral one . \\nso he generally doesn\\'t have any real problems as a human being , and is therefore boring . . . except that he is played by will smith , who embodies him with about as much will smith charm as he can without entering \" id4 \" / \" men in black \" territory . \\nhe\\'s a good dramatic actor ( just see the first half hour of \" six degrees of separation \" for proof of this , not that he isn\\'t great the whole time ) , and here , he makes his character likable and sympathetic without any real strain on his character , which makes the film lack any real deep interesting qualities . \\nsmith becomes involved in a mass conspiracy involving the assasination of a senator opposed to a government law that would create world surveillance , extinguishing privacy as we know it from the world , under the pretense that it would make crime easier to control , when he is passed a disk of the event caught on tape by an outside party ( a nature observer played by , uh , jason lee ) . \\nthe government wants the disk , and is prepared to destroy his life to get it . \\nas smith\\'s plight is dramatized , we are introduced to the masterminds who surveillance him , sitting in vans disguised as other businesses , staring at computers and pulling out tricks faster than a speeding bullet . \\nthese guys ( played by jack black , jamie kennedy , and seth green ) are the most interesting part of this film because they\\'re , well , fascinating : they\\'re doing their jobs , which are evil , but the film doesn\\'t view them as such , and they almost become our friends . \\nwe like these guys for the sole reason that the film doesn\\'t automatically judge them as the villains . \\nthey\\'re also scary because we get the idea that they\\'re not fully aware of the impact their jobs have on the world . \\nit\\'s as if they\\'re obsessed with their jobs , not because they\\'re evil , but because , hey , it\\'s a fun job , and no one else can do it like them . \\nunfortunately , this also backfires a bit on the film : instead of being the flashlight in the darkened room that \" the game \" was , you see everything , and are thus not as freaked out because you know what is going on . \\nsure , you\\'re chilled , but you\\'re not exacty freaked out by what\\'s going on . \\nbut what do you expect from tony scott , the man who never met a five-second piece of film he ever liked . \\nhe\\'s a not-bad director because , hell , he is always interesting to watch ( if not occasionally moronic - exhibit a : \" days of thunder \" ) , but the reason he\\'s not great is because he\\'s too technical and calculated . \\nhis shots are perfectly executed , and leave nothing to the imagination , and they\\'re always making sure you\\'re paying attention . \\nthis is incredibly annoying , and it reduces \" enemy of the state \" to a mechanical mishmash of flashy images that never expand the mind at any great depths , but still manage to entertain without any real problems . \\ndespite never actually becoming great , it\\'s never actually boring and it\\'s always intriguing . \\nwatching the government set-up smith is endlessly fascinating , and since we care about smith\\'s likeable protagonist , we are set-up for a good two hours worth of tom clancy-esque entertainment . \\nadd the best big cast this side of the annual woody allen film ( everyone from gabriel byrne to dan butler pop up for cameos ) , and you\\'ve got a good old fashioned escapist drama which does all the thinking for you so that you never have to actually question the debate over personal privacy and so you can follow will smith\\'s plight without a minute\\'s worth of boredom . \\n',\n",

i was so overcome by the sum total of what i had witnessed . \\nmore than anything , the film is like a master painting . \\neach cinematic brush stroke is carefully laid down by egoyan with the beauty building with each dollop of paint . \\nwith the final color in place , the masterpiece is complete , and the ending credits roll . \\nthe sweet hereafter runs 1 : 50 . \\nit is rated r for mature themes , sexuality and some profanity and would be fine teenagers . \\n',\n",
              " 'i can hear the question already . \\nwhat on earth do these two movies have in common ? \\nto most people , not a lot , except that both are by renowned directors . \\nas i saw them , however , both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers . \\nbut oh , how differently the packages affect their films . \\nwhile \" everyone\\'s \" production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special , jane campion\\'s imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones\\' script is . \\ni left \" everyone says i love you \" not remembering a lot about who loved whom , but its infectious happiness put a grin on my face . \\ni left \" the portrait of a lady \" not remembering a lot about who loved whom , and i could have cared less . \\n \" everyone \" features nothing allen hasn\\'t done before storywise . \\nwoody is again desperately in love with a beautiful woman ( roberts ) , and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrong--again . \\nsimilar situations happen to his family and friends . \\nsome of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his \" early , funny \" films . \\nthe scenes between tim roth and drew barrymore could have come out of \" take the money and run , \" his directorial debut . \\nhowever , nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this one-of-a-kind display of sheer good spirits . \\nin fact , in this movie , the feeling itself is what\\'s most important . \\nyes , the movie would have been better--among his very best , i think--if it had a meatier story . \\nbut what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling . \\nand what better way to express feeling than through music ? \\nlove is often best expressed in a song , and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart . \\nsome are a tad too goofy , such as the number where a lot of ghosts prance around in a funeral parlor , but i admired allen for even putting them in there . \\nit also helps that as usual , allen has a top-flight cast working with him . \\ntheir singing voices range from quite good ( goldie hawn ) to not quite good ( allen ) to literally unlistenable ( barrymore , whose real voice was dubbed by a professional ) . \\nbut while their vocal abilities differ , all the actors do a great job of putting joy up there on the screen , and making it rub off on the audience . \\ngranted , some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies , but for those attuned to it , this film should work wonders . \\njane campion , too , has a top-flight cast working for her in \" portrait of a lady , \" too , but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep the film from being a stilted , virtually lifeless mess , albeit a visually interesting one . \\ncampion and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with a great variety of eye-filling images that linger in the mind . \\nunfortunately , what didn\\'t linger in the mind for me was the story the visuals were supposed to be reflecting . \\ni remember very well shots of a train with its light beaming and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman , but i can remember very little of what happened between all these people . \\neven worse , i don\\'t find myself feeling bad that i\\'ve forgotten . \\nthe problem , i think , lies not with the cast , which seemed to be trying very hard for the material . \\nit was the script that couldn\\'t convince me to care about anyone . \\nthe characters were putting out all kinds of emotion , but i found no reason to connect with any of them . \\ni understood that the story was about cold , emotionally vacant characters , but for me to care about them , i have to identify with them somehow and want them to inject feeling into their lives . \\njones\\' script never simply gave me that opportunity . \\nin the end , it almost seemed as if campion was trying to inject some life of her own into the proceedings with her visual flourishes . \\nunfortunately , as she kept painting these dazzling pictures , they only served to push me further away from the material and remind me that there was no connection between me and the film . \\nin the end , the movie\\'s one strength ended up hurting it . \\nso here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots , and yet i was able to truly enjoy one of them . \\nwhy ? \\nwith both films , my head cared about neither story , but only \" everyone says i love you \" was able to make my heart sing . \\n',\n",

              " 'when i left the theater after seeing david lynch\\'s \" lost highway , \" i remarked to a fellow movie-goer , \" i feel like someone just sucked my brains out through my nose and put them back in through my ears . \" \\nin his first feature film in five years , lynch delivers a film second only to his debut picture \" eraserhead \" on the weirdness scale . \\nyou won\\'t \" know \" what happened when it\\'s over , though there are certainly enough clues with which to make some reasonable guesses . \\nit is difficult to describe the plot of this film , because it depends partly on how you interpret it . \\ni can , however , describe what we see on the screen : l . a . jazz saxophonist fred madison ( bill pullman ) and his wife renee ( patricia arquette ) , whom he clearly suspects of infidelity , receive a series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house while they were asleep . \\nthey are , naturally enough , more than a little frightened and confused , and it doesn\\'t help matters any when \" mystery man \" ( robert blake ) approaches fred at a party and proceeds to call himself on the telephone at the madisons\\' house in a scene that is at once hilarious and unnerving . \\nthe next morning , fred finds another videotape which , to his ( and our ) surprise , shows him brutally murdering renee in their bedroom . \\nhe is convicted of her murder and sent to death row , where he inexplicably disappears one night and is replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton ( balthazar getty ) . \\nthe perplexed prison officials release dayton , whose life begins to intersect with fred in a number of ways - most notably his affair with alice wakefield ( arquette again ) , a blonde who is otherwise renee\\'s spitting image , and another encounter with the mystery man . \\ni would be giving away a little too much to reveal any more , but suffice it to say that lynch doesn\\'t offer any neat wrap ? ups , nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion : the cinematic demons of \" lost highway \" are out in full force from beginning to end . \\nthis description might make \" lost highway \" sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism , but in fact , while there are traces of lynch\\'s weird sense of humor , this film is anything but giddy most of the time . \\non the contrary , lost highway is a dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynch\\'s previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther . \\nthe film does not revolve around a character investigating a mystery ; rather , the character * is * the mystery . \\nthere are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion , distrust , and infidelity thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded , fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goings-on here . \\nwe , the audience , are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this ( probably fred\\'s , in my opinion ) and what , in that case , the other characters and events are meant to represent . \\nall of this proceeds , appropriately , in lynch\\'s typically slow-paced , idiosyncratic style . \\nas is often the case , lynch relies on sound , imagery , and mood more than on dialogue and action to tell his story , and in \" lost highway \" it works perfectly . \\nthere are scenes when the camera lingers on fred\\'s blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway , or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coil\\'s \" song to the siren \" can be heard faintly in the background ; nothing is technically \" happening \" in these scenes , yet they present a vivid picture of a man losing his grip just as effective as , if not more so than , the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity . \\nlynch\\'s direction and director of photography pete deming\\'s darkly lit cinematography serve to create a nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension and fear that are exactly what is needed for this story . \\nwell , most of the time , anyway - i have to admit that i was a bit bored at times during the section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist , which is less inherently interesting and mostly keeps the viewer\\'s attention because of its tie-ins to the original mystery . \\nthe main characters in this \" reality \" - dayton ( a well-meaning but none too intelligent 24-year-old ) , a sleazy gangster ( who for some reason has two names but otherwise is pretty much a stock character ) , and his porn-star girlfriend ( the blond arquette ) - are nothing you couldn\\'t find in any of the two dozen \" pulp fiction \" wannabes ; fortunately , the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements , such as the strained , awkward conversations between pete and his parents , help to preserve the film\\'s spooky , unnerving tone during this stretch . \\nlynch\\'s typically graphic and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality , while relevant to the themes of jealousy and adultery , are also somewhat overdone here . \\nit\\'s not exactly exploitative - like almost everything else in this film , the sex is thoroughly weird and creepy and is unlikely to provide any cheap lurid thrills - as much as it is unnecessary and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off . \\nthat said , these minor flaws don\\'t prevent \" lost highway \" from attaining its place as one of the darkest , most unsettling films to hit the screens in recent years . \\nit is a one-way ride down the lost highway of a disturbed mind , and as such it is gripping , intense , and brilliantly effective . \\n',\n",

that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction ( although much less cynical ) . \\nbut no matter . . . \\njackson is very strong in his role . \\nrobert de niro is actually a little annoying at times , but overall he does a good job as one of ordell\\'s perspective clients and friends . \\nrobert forster gives one of the best performances in the film , as he has one of the most developed characters . \\nhe is present throughout most of the film , and he holds his own against jackson and grier . \\njackie brown is rated r for language , sex , violence , drug use , and

              " \"let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film , i really wasn't looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films . \\ni'm not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever-present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years . \\ni'm happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film . \\nby that point , it was evident that mr . bond was back with a vengeance . \\nall doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren't exactly a pleasant experience . \\nit seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts . \\nit took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in . \\ni guess they can be excused though , taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain . \\nanyway , after somebody remembered what the light switch was for , i settled in for bond . \\ni think the most noticeable aspect of this , the 19th film in the series , is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films . \\nthere were probably more one-liners in this movie than in the last several combined . \\nand bond's last one-liner in the film is about the best of the series . \\nthe world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series . \\neverything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007 . \\nfor the most part , the action sequences worked very well . \\nalthough , there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top , even for a bond film . \\ni think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted . \\nwhile he did a good job for the most part , there were points in the movie , specifically during action sequences , that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film . \\nmost noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie . \\nhe almost seemed like he didn't know what he was doing . \\nbut they were brief scenes and really shouldn't take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing . \\nif you have ever seen a bond film , you won't be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit . \\nthe world is not enough is no exception . \\nthis time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world . \\n007 matches wits with the terrorist renard ( robert carlyle ) , a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain . \\nwhy this point is included is beyond me . \\nthey took great pains to explain his condition , but it only came up later in the movie as a scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought . \\nanyway , renard , like the typical terrorist that he is , is bent on some harebrained scheme involving a mid-east oil pipeline . \\ni guess world domination just isn't as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore . \\nbond is brought in to protect the pipeline's owner , elektra king ( sophie marceau ) , who is the daughter of one of renard's recent victims . \\nalong the way , bond has to enlist the help of a nuclear scientist , dr . christmas jones ( denise richards ) , and his old rival valentin zukovsky ( robert carlyle ) . \\nlike all bond films , you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot , since it is ridiculous beyond words . \\nmy biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films . \\nthere was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing . \\nthe buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau's character . \\nit was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly -- although not included in the film . \\nlater , it became a big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something . \\nbut because it is a bond film , the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly . \\nafter all , it isn't shakespeare . \\nhow about the cast ? \\nbrosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as 007 . \\ni grew up with the roger moore version of bond , so i really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character . \\njudi dench , as m , had a bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the role . \\nshe brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner . \\nrobbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye , so it was nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie . \\ncoltrane gets more screen time , which simply leads to him stealing even more scenes . \\nthen there are the bond girls . \\nsophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today . \\nthere is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her a natural to play the innocent victim . \\nthose that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just a pretty face . \\nmarceau may be the most talented actress to ever play a bond love interest . \\nthen we have denise richards . \\nthere was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks . \\nand after you see the outfits she wears , you won't have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producer's eyes . \\ni was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did a good job playing a nuclear scientist . \\nadmittedly , there was one point that the audience snickered a bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue , but other than that she stacks up ( no pun intended ) to her bond girl predecessors nicely . \\ni must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyle's character . \\nwhile carlyle did a fine job with the material that he had , his character just never worked for me . \\nthe producers tried very hard to add more complexity to his character , but it just never quite got off the ground . \\ni guess i was hoping for a bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character , but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character . \\nthis might have worked well in another movie , but i don't go to see bond movies for their deep characterizations . \\nlast , but not least , we have desmond llewelyn as q . this is the 17th appearance for llewelyn as bond's gadget guy , and he is as good as ever . \\nalthough his screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films , he is still a treat to watch . \\nrumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the role . \\nhe says future appearances are up to a higher power . \\nthe producers have introduced his protege and future replacement , a bumbling and somewhat pompous character played by comedy master john cleese . \\nwhile we don't see much of him in this film , i think it is fair to say that desmond llewelyn's legacy , whenever it is passed on , will be in very capable hands . \\nso how does it stack up ? \\ndespite some problems , the world is not enough is a very entertaining movie . \\nand , all things considered , what problems it does have are small compared to some that have plagued earlier bond movies . \\nthis is easily the best of the brosnan films . \\nit may even be the best of the entire series , certainly in the top 3 . \\none thing is for sure , even after 19 movies , there is still plenty of life left in the james bond series . \\nhere's looking forward to bond number 20 . \\n\",\n",

              " 'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\njames toback\\'s return to directing after a eight-year layoff , two girls and a guy , is a film which is comprised , more or less , of just that : one guy , blake ( robert downey jr . ) ; two girls , carla ( heather graham ) and lou ( natasha gregson wagner ) ; one primary setting ( blake\\'s absurdly spacious bachelor apartment ) , and a great deal of dialogue . \\nembracing a near real-time approach , this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr . toback for his bantering characters . \\nfortunately , the film\\'s cast is up to the challenge , and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters , while admittedly variable , are occasionally wickedly amusing . \\nthe film\\'s setup is fairly generic in nature , and opens rather unpromisingly . \\nwe meet self-possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou , both waiting outside a soho loft . \\nas they engage in idle chatter , it is revealed that they\\'re both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport , and it doesn\\'t take long for them to come to the realisation that they\\'re being two-timed by the same guy . \\nmore indignant with him than catty with each other , the duo break into blake\\'s loft and await his arrival for a confrontation . \\nit\\'s when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride . \\nplayed with magnificent bombast by mr . downey jr . , blake is a cad , all right , but a captivatingly dynamic , blusterous , and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights . \\nit\\'s fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat , and perhaps the film\\'s best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return , allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others , but by his own innate behaviour . \\nwhether he\\'s flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi , or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds ( carla , lou , and his unseen sickly mother ) , it\\'s never less than wildly entertaining and insightful . \\nthough at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one-man show -- a typical afternoon in the life of blake , if you will -- carla , and then lou , reveal themselves , and the sparks begin to fly . \\n ( one of the great touches in the film is how blake , when startled by carla\\'s unannounced appearance , begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat\\'s out of the bag . ) \\ndouble-teamed by the understandably aggrieved women ( who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful -- they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy ) , an increasingly-flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self-righteous declarations against their verbal jabs . \\nsurprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters , two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was off-limits for this film . \\nhowever , it\\'d be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou\\'s outrage to full feature-length , and it\\'s as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel . \\nthe dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever , the film\\'s tempo loses its liveliness , the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion , and several sequences fall flat . \\nsubtle and not-quite-subtle allusions are made ( a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall ) , and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale . \\none key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla . \\ntwo girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter , long-running dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene -- contractually-obligated to deliver an r-rated film , mr . toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaled-down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc-17 rating in favour of an r -- and while admittedly titillating , the net effect of the vignette on the film\\'s thematic narrative is rather dubious . \\nif anything , two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr . downey jr . , whose versatility is put to the test in this film . \\nhe plays the gamut from indignant to humbled , from self-assured to disconcerted , yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered . \\nit\\'s a wonderful performance in a role custom-tailored for him ; mr . toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr . downey jr . was arrested on drug charges , and it\\'s hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character -- in a monologue to his mirrored reflection , blake\\'s self-chiding to \" get [his] shit together \" is disquieting in its resonance . \\nwhile mr . downey jr . \\'s showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film , both actresses are solid in more broadly-observed roles . \\nms . graham is quickly becoming one of america\\'s more daring actresses , involving herself in three successive risky projects -- two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank , while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman . \\nshe\\'s quite appealing here , playing a character at once both dainty and sultry . \\nmeanwhile , ms . gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying , or , like me , endearing . \\nshe tones it down substantially as the film progresses , but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox . \\nthe film was reportedly shot in eleven days , filmed mostly in sequence , and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout . \\ntwo girls and a guy has an agile , spontaneous sort of feel , and one senses that mr . toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actors . \\nwhile the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact , it doesn\\'t feel constricted ; the expansive apartment setting is well-used to vary the background , and mr . toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner . \\ntwo girls and a guy falls short of its potential , but thanks to some stellar work by mr . downey jr . , it\\'s still often an enjoyable , bitingly funny romp , particularly as we watch the surprisingly-resilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends . \\n \" i\\'m an actor , \" he tells them at one point , using the ol\\' tried-and-tested occupational-hazard defense . \\n \" actors lie . \" \\nbut not , they all seem to agree , denzel washington . \\n',\n",

              " 'i\\'m not quite sure how best to go about writing this review . \\ni must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson\\'s political satire \" wag the dog , \" but in retrospect , this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it . \\nquite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through , and it didn\\'t do that . \\nthey also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all-too-true attack on the way the american political media works , and it didn\\'t quite do that either . \\na few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubrick\\'s \" dr . \\nstrangelove \" in the tradition of political black comedy , and it most definitely didn\\'t do that . \\nthat said , \" wag the dog \" is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them . \\nthe story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean ( robert deniro ) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president , who is up for re-election in two weeks , sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office . \\nthe accusations , the script suggests , are probably untrue , but as brean so pointedly puts it , that isn\\'t particularly relevant : the scandal is likely to derail the president\\'s campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood . \\nbrean , along with his assistant ( anne heche ) , decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss ( dustin hoffman ) to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and special-effects trickery to make it appear that the u . s . is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor . \\nas i said , \" wag the dog \" is not quite as laugh-out-loud hilarious as i had expected , but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here , such as when , in an echo of a familiar movie clich ? , the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting , inspirational music , then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform \" we have the right to fight for democracy . \" \\nanother scene shows us how , with modern editing equipment , an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village . \\nthe most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda team\\'s attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt . \\nwilliam \" old shoe \" schumann ( woody harrelson ) , an ex-military officer who turns out to be a first-class psycho . \\nof course , not everything goes as planned ; the cia , for example , realizes what\\'s going on and strikes a deal with the president\\'s electoral opponent to report to the media that the \" fighting \" has ended , forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis . \\nstill , even with the cia\\'s involvement , the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable . \\nregardless of the official word from the president or the cia , wouldn\\'t the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is , in fact , no fighting going on in albania ? \\nthe film never addresses this question , nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical , such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt . \\nschumann ; we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it . \\nthere was also an instance , towards the end of the film , in which one of motss\\'s forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away . \\nwith these plot holes , \" wag the dog \" doesn\\'t quite work as a satire of american politics , but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place . \\nbrean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical ; rather , they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off . \\nthe film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end , as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret . \\nmotss and his hollywood buddies , meanwhile , seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project . \\nin fact , one of the sources of conflict in the film is motss\\'s increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war ; in his mind , it is the greatest work of art he has ever created . \\ni think it\\'s fair to say that \" wag the dog \" underachieves a little bit : more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four-star film and a classic satire . \\nstill , the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one . \\nwag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks , what if the war wasn\\'t even real ?

\" \\nthey did do it . \\nit\\'s there . \\ni was almost more appalled by the fact that this didn\\'t bother the other audience members with whom i saw this film . \\ni found it deplorable . \\nand when krippendorf is forced to admit that he did it , he simply apologizes without the slightest hint of conviction in his voice . \\nthe film is filled with scenes like these . \\nthey not only insult the audience , but they insult the types of people that the film portrays . \\nit would take some truly professional work to create videos convincing enough to fool an entire community of scientists , yet krippendorf does it easily in an afternoon . \\nand watching dreyfuss stumble over a completely unprepared speech is funny and entertaining , but i think that most members of the on-screen audience would be able to see that he is making everything up as he goes . \\nif i were an anthropologist , this film would insult me immensely . \\nmoving right along , the film plays off every stereotype our culture has ever learned regarding african tribes . \\nsure , dreyfuss dressing up like a chief is really funny , and it allows for some entertaining scenes , but the heart of this material is deeply clueless as to the themes and thoughts that it provokes . \\nit is because of dreyfuss as an actor that i was able to watch this film . \\nhis character here is not a good subject for a film because he is a shameless liar , and never once does he show any kind of penance for what he does . \\ni suppose it was interesting to see the formula defied in this case , but for the purposes of good taste , i would have expected something . \\nno , this man sets a terrible example for his kids and colleagues , and the writer of the film ( charlie peters ) didn\\'t include a single scene in which krippendorf takes his kids aside and tells them that what he is doing is very bad . \\nin fact , it\\'s his eldest daughter that frequently tells him that he is doing the wrong thing , and he continually shrugs off her warnings . \\ni suppose it\\'s important to admit that this is a funny film . \\ndreyfuss and elfman , and many of the contrived and insulting scenes , add up to a picture that is anything but boring . \\nand if you\\'re less serious than i , you probably will enjoy it . \\ni , however , can\\'t get past these elements . \\nkrippendorf\\'s tribe is being marketed as a family comedy , but this is the kind of film that teaches the kids of our society faulty lessons that they shouldn\\'t be learning . \\nwith a little more insight into its story and themes , this could have been a good movie . \\n',\n",

              " 'studio 54 attracted so many weird and bizarre people to its gates that it\\'s a wonder why the film about the life and death of the studio centers itself on one very boring , cliched individual , not to mention an ensemble of people who wouldn\\'t be at all fascinating unless they worked at the studio , which they did according to this film . \\nare we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated the studio nightly , that a character who is a bland ripoff of tony manero would really make a good protagonist for the film about it ? \\n \" 54 \" belongs in the elite group of films known as \" the big disappointments \" : the films that attain so much hype and/or so much potential in its creation that they come off worse than they are when they are finally finished . \\ni was heavily awaiting \" 54 , \" not the least because i\\'ve become fascinated with the infamous club , which has been the subject of an engrossing documentary that\\'s been running all summer on vh1 , which is , weirdly enough , much more intriguing and engrossing than this \" edgy \" film . \\nperhaps more importantly , \" 54 \" is part of the blossoming subgenre , \" the 70s nostalgia film , \" which has been picking up mighty steam , what with \" boogie nights \" and \" the last days of disco \" coming out within the year , and both being such damn good movies that not only captured the feel of a certain time period ( the late 70s party and the early 80s wakeup period ) , but brought us interesting and real characters , like scotty , the tragically gay boom mike operator from \" boogie nights , \" and charlotte , the ironically clueless and bitchy co-protagonist from \" the last days of disco , \" not to mention several others . \\n \" 54 \" deals not so much with the timeline of the studio ( how it began , how it was run , how it ended ) - that\\'s all dealt with in the narrated opening and finale - but more interested in the characters who populated it . \\nthis is a definite plus . \\nhere\\'s a film that could have been a fascinating 2 hour plus film about the tragic people who went there to party , and had to wakeup in the 80s when things like diseases , economy problems , and perhaps worst of all , reagan , all hit and forced everyone into a rude awakening . \\nthe story of the studio is tragedy in itself : let\\'s look at how it all affected the people . \\nbut this film doesn\\'t let that happen . \\nit gives us a half-assed protagonist named shane o\\'shea ( ryan phillippe , from \" i know what you did last summer \" ) , who\\'s chief character trait is the fact that he\\'s from new jersey , which also happens to be his chief character flaw ( i guess ) . \\nhe\\'s dim-witted , into being part of \" the scene , \" and soon finds he\\'s become a bit of a rave amongst the studio regulars . . . a \\nbit like \" saturday night fever , \" \\'cept no travolta and no real interest put into him . \\npoor , poor phillippe struggles to make him interesting , but all he is a half-assed character and not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside the club that he could have been . \\nshane begins to hang out with some other denizens of the club , like anita ( salma hayek ) , a wannabe donna sommers , and her young hubby , greg randanzo ( breckin meyer , from \" clueless \" ) , who helps shane become a bartender and rise to a bit of fame . \\nalthough he begins to get somewhere when he sleeps with the foxy billie auster ( sela ward ) , an exec of sorts , he falls in lust with a soap star named julie black ( neve campbell ) , and thus the boring romance subplot that\\'s all too not necessarily important to anything else in the film and never really becomes interesting at any point in the film . \\nthe film\\'s sole point of interest and one major strongpoint is the all-too necesary personage of steve rubell , played by mike myers ( you heard me ) . \\nrubell , the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever , and is an easy metaphor for the life and times of his creation , but the film , thanks to a surprisingly strong performance by myers , makes him out to be more than that . \\nnotice the scenes sole shocking scene , where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion : myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene , and a couple others , that some of us who\\'ve only seen him on tv never saw , and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails . \\nfirst time feature director mark christopher proves that he\\'s a better director than a writer , though not too terribly much . \\nhis story is trite and shallow , as are his characters , and his direction is shockingly flat , especially for a film about this subject . \\nit\\'s as if he had a great story to tell , but instead opted for the easier route . \\nthe studio\\'s recreation is amazingly accurate , though , and very impressive , but his direction is never captivating enough . \\nsome people say that a film does its job if it makes you want to visit the locale it takes place in ( despite the film\\'s tone , i still want to go to rome and its many nightclubs after i saw fellini\\'s \" la dolce vita \" ) , and when i watched \" 54 , \" i didn\\'t particularly want to stay . \\n',\n",

              " 'in 1987 the stock market crashed , and oliver stone\\'s wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses . \\nwall street lucked out in its timing ; the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had , and though its kill-or-be-killed approach to business was exaggerated , that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan-era businessman . \\nstone constructed his film as a mythical good vs . evil tale relayed in the fast-paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange . \\ncritics and audiences lauded wall street , elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic . \\ni\\'m proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them . \\ni found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone\\'s output with its thin caricatures , obvious sentiments , and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen . \\nstone goes for broke in every scene ( the same could be said for nearly all of his works ) . \\nthis approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions . \\nhe directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane . \\nit\\'s all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity , rather than explore what these situations are really like . \\ni have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative ( as they are presented in boiler room ) rather than laughably over the top . \\nthese guys are salesmen after all , not televised judges . \\nmore than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street . \\nthe only possible solution i can muster is its release date . \\nand not just the timeliness of the \" greed is good \" subject matter : the film was plumped down in the eighties , a decade in which the one-joke comedy rose to an art form , and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept , low result movies . \\nin my mind , the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies , but bad music , bad hair , and bad clothes . \\nmaybe stone\\'s after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace . \\nboiler room is an equally well-timed film with some similarities to stone\\'s piece of crap . \\nthey both feature a consequential father-son relationship , though boiler room\\'s is much more subtle and touching . \\nand they are both concerned with the power of greed , yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slippery-smooth , heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street . \\nboiler room is a message movie as well , though ( at least until the end ) doesn\\'t shove it in our faces . \\nboiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash . \\nas i said , this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day ( bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn\\'t been seen in quite a while ) ; not only do we want to be millionaires , we want to watch other people become millionaires ! \\nin our super-judgmental , power-oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything ; when you have money , you have it \" all \" . \\nand seth ( giovanni ribisi ) wants it \" all \" the easy way . \\nhe\\'s a well-intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm ( the kind that sells junk stock ) whereupon he meets others just like him . \\nben affleck is cast as jim , the company headhunter , who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko . \\nhis job is to influence trainee\\'s into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood . \\nit\\'s ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b . s that they\\'re told to dish out to prospective buyers . \\naffleck\\'s character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin\\'s similar character in glengary glen ross , and that proves detrimental to the actor\\'s performance . \\naffleck shouts , curses and be-littles his rookie employees just like baldwin , minus the edge . \\nwhen alec played the scene he became the part , spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own . \\nby comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading . \\nthe brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks : they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game . \\nrap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are : intellectual gangsters . \\nthey aren\\'t above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes . \\nwe drink up this world along with seth , and watch him become seduced by it , just like we might be . \\nas in all cautionary tales , boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing , then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness . \\ni know this story . \\nwe all do . \\nbut it can work if it\\'s told with intelligence and energy , and that is how writer \\\\ director ben younger tells it . \\nas a director of ( please excuse my french ) mise-en-scene younger has much to learn . \\nhis style is sitcom bland . \\nbut his writing isn\\'t . \\nyounger\\'s script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch ; his dialogue is like a junior david mamet . \\ndespite the moderate camera work younger fills his phone-pitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script . \\nthe brokers \\\\ hucksters counter every customer objection , gently bullying them into buying stock . \\nthese moments are filmed like psychological action scenes : a tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who isn\\'t aware that he is one . \\nwith the exception of affleck\\'s brief appearances , the performances are truly exceptional . \\nribisi , who has the edgy looks of a character actor , is extremely potent here , working his pale angular face , and eerie , plaintive stare for all their worth . \\nhe conveys child-like vulnerability ( his character seems to hide in a corner whenever things aren\\'t going his way ) in some scenes , and in others he\\'s ferociously cut throat . \\nthe jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie : ribisi is confident when it\\'s just him and the phone , but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father ( authoritatively played by ron rifkin ) . \\nboiler room thankfully avoids wall street-like histrionics in the sales-pitch sequences ; the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys . \\nthose ploys are taught to seth by chris ( vin diesel ) , a kind broker who alternates between seth\\'s friend and his mentor . \\ndiesl shines in his minor role . \\nthis week i saw the sci-fi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner . \\nin that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the 80\\'s , and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone to elliot gould in the 70\\'s . \\nnicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what he can\\'t have . \\nnia long , as the firm\\'s secretary , ( a lone black women amongst many white men ) is ribisi\\'s love interest in a part that at first looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets , but develops into something more interesting . \\nthe two make an oddly likeable couple . \\nlong is smart and brash , and ribisi is charmingly aloof . \\nat one point he says to her \" i\\'m just lookin\\' for some chocolate love \" . \\nit\\'s a terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous child-like way , it becomes sweetly endearing . \\nunfortunately , towards the end , the boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy . \\nthere is much crying , hugging , and sorrowful stares . \\nthis is okay when taken in small doses , but younger\\'s conclusion is constructed as a series of these boo-hoo moments , one following the other . \\na particular misstep is his attempt to show the effect that seth\\'s manipulations have on one of his poor victims . \\nit\\'s not a bad idea but the execution is lacking , with those scenes feeling tacked on to further spell out the message . \\nthat message being , \" greed is bad \" . \\nyes it\\'s patently obvious , but boiler room conveys it by introducing us to a culture that i haven\\'t seen much of in the movies : the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur . \\nand all wall street did was introduce us to a simplistic fantasy world of saints and sinners . \\nboiler room offers neither extreme . \\nit gives us what is in between , and for that i am thankful . \\n',\n",

              " 'cinematically speaking , gordon parks\\' original 1971 _shaft_ is not a great film . \\na bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action , this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman\\'s \" black private dick that\\'s a sex machine to all the chicks \" to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking . \\nyet nearly 30 years after its original release--and long after the genre it spawned , \" blaxploitation , \" died with that decade--the 1971 _shaft_ remains an extremely entertaining watch , never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness . \\nthe reason for this is the same one that explains the film\\'s connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african-american audience : the title character of john shaft . \\nwhile the fact that the strong , smart , virile , and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance , his broad-based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race : he is comfortable , confident , and proud about who he is , and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass . \\nthis fact also explains why john singleton\\'s y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is . \\nmuch like the film that started the franchise , this _shaft_\\'s plot doesn\\'t score points in the originality department , but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers . \\ncontrary to what has been reported over the past few months , this _shaft_ is not a remake of the original film , but more of a sequel/spinoff . \\nthe star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels ( 1972\\'s _shaft\\'s_big_score ! _ and 1973\\'s _shaft_in_africa_ ) , richard roundtree , once again plays john shaft , who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city . \\nhowever , the focus of the film lies on his same-named nephew ( samuel l . jackson ) , who , as the film begins , is a cop whose take-no-crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors . \\nwhen a privileged young man named walter wade jr . ( christian bale ) accused of a brutal , racially-motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail , a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p . i . \\nbut that\\'s easier said than done , for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez ( jeffrey wright ) , a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri ( toni collette ) , the only eyewitness to his crime . \\npeoples--or , rather , wright is also the big obstacle in jackson\\'s way toward commanding this film . \\npeoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time , and wright is insanely funny during these stages . \\nhowever , he isn\\'t so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish , and peoples\\' eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable ( which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo , who bowed out before filming ) . \\nit\\'s no easy task to steal a film from the jackson ( who is his usual captivating , charismatic self here ) , but that\\'s exactly what wright does--and makes it seem effortless . \\nthen again , with such a talented ensemble surrounding him , it is not too surprising that jackson\\'s impressive star turn doesn\\'t quite tower over the rest ; he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co-stars . \\nbale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in _american_psycho_ , so it only follows that his performance as a similar , less exaggerated character would be spot-on . \\ncollette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened , conflicted diane . \\nbusta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft\\'s sidekick rasaan . \\nregistering not as strongly--but through no fault of their own--are vanessa williams ( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez ) and a dismayingly underused roundtree ; they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price , singleton , and shane salerno . \\n ( jackson also has little to \" do \" in a sense ; some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside , his shaft doesn\\'t even have one sex scene . ) \\nthat singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since he\\'s not really an action director . \\nthis is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases . \\nthey move well ( as does the film as a whole ) and are reasonably exciting ; it\\'s just that there\\'s nothing terribly inventive about them . \\nthese set pieces are functional in the way the script is : they work well enough , but they\\'re unsurprising and conventional . \\nbut if there\\'s anything that a _shaft_ movie does well , it\\'s make the familiar look cool--and this _shaft_ keeps that tradition alive . \\nfrom the slick title sequence--scored , of course , to isaac hayes\\' ever-infectious oscar-winning theme song , which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film--on , the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado . \\neven a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced , it feels necessary . \\nstyle doesn\\'t exactly make for a great film , but when it comes to _shaft_ , that\\'s of little consequence . \\nwhat matters above all else is having a good time , and the latest _shaft_ should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad mutha--shut your mouth . \\n',\n",

' \\nbecause so many outside factors come into play in the film's plot and significance as part of a trilogy , and just considering modern society , it again would be difficult , if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story . ] \\nfirst of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it . \\nwe know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker , who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire . \\nwe know obi-wan `ben' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force' in attempts to become a jedi knight , but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side . ' \\nwe also know something about `the force' itself , that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it ( the jedi ) . \\nwhat we don't know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy , which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth . \\nto me , this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle , definite order to all the complexity . \\nalso , it seems that we're supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended . \\nmost notably , details regarding the emperor from `empire' and `jedi , ' and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine . \\nfor those who haven't kept up with all the `star wars' paraphernalia over the years , there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor ( or his voice at least ) . \\nwith `the phantom menace' being the first chapter of a long saga , one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid , including the history behind all the major factors of the series , especially `the force' and the jedi knights . \\nunfortunately , this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained . \\ni didn't liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness . \\nif you're going to tell a story from the beginning - tell it from the beginning ( is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes -1 through -3 to clarify the back story even further ? ) . \\nbut i digress . \\ni've said so much and yet i haven't even touched on the specifics of the film itself . \\nall these necessary `disclaiming' elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars' series is and this individual film itself . \\nwhat we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we've come to know and love since the late 1970s . \\nits similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar , but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality . \\nthe basic story is rather sorted , complex and even confusing at times . \\nwe're told that an army known as `the trade federation' has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo . \\nwe're not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is , instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly . \\nwe're introduced to two jedi , the master qui-gon jinn ( neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( mcgregor ) . \\nthe two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet's queen , amidala ( portman ) . \\nthe leader of the federation , an alien called viceroy , is following the orders of a strange , mythical character - an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears . \\nhe is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance , and especially that creepy evil voice of his , he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series . \\nsidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person . \\nclearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity ( which is never openly revealed in the film , but should be clear to most viewers . \\ni have a feeling we'll delve into his background in the next two films ) . \\nbut it doesn't take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film's story begins to move along . \\nthe film doesn't have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini-plot and adventure on top of another . \\nthere are so many of these mini-plots-within-plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook . \\nthe other films have relied on this type of storytelling , but because of the limits of the technology at the time , the films' screenplays were also limiting . \\nthe sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace' its unique traits . \\nas we already know , the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original `star wars' trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and/or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story . \\nand here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10-year-old anakin skywalker ( lloyd ) , by qui-gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council . \\nto briefly summarize the story , jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala's spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation . \\ntheir meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force . \\njinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force , and through another sub-plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter , more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves . \\nthis also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before . \\nin fact , it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before . \\nthe element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary . \\nby the film's third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot . \\nit's funny how the reality of the `star wars' world seems so embedded in mythology , new age-like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence . \\nnot that this technique hasn't been used in movies and in real-life situations countless times throughout history . \\nand at least it's all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter . \\nit does border of the cartoonish sometimes , but that's just the film appealing to our inner child , which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society . \\n`the phantom menace' delivers exactly what you'd expect from a `star wars' film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness . \\nso many things in the film we've seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited . \\nbut this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies . \\n\",\n",

              " 'seen february 15 , 1998 on home video ( borrowed from chris wessell ) . \\nwhen it comes to modern gangster movies , it\\'s really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and/or just using the word \" routine . \" \\ni\\'ve always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea ( no matter how many times it\\'s been used before ) can provide for a good story and \" donnie brasco \" clinches this idea . \\nit\\'s not unlike most of the great films of the genre , yet it never apes another\\'s style as it has a good layer of authenticity , even if its core is a tad stale . \\nthe film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it . \\nwe meet lefty ( pacino ) , an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk . \\nhe and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this . \\nsomehow he comes across donnie brasco ( depp ) , a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isn\\'t afraid of lefty and his rep , and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him . \\nit\\'s clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately , telling him all the tricks of the trade . \\ni have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit . \\nhowever , we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone , an fbi agent working undercover - a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer . \\nthe first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor , a brief history of the mob , definitions of their slang , and where their money comes from and who it goes to . \\nthe screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements , however , the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original . \\nmost gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works ( probably from watching other gangster movies ) , and although this attitude comes across , the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable . \\nthankfully the film doesn\\'t become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime , and instead opts for character development . \\nmuch of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie . \\npacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would . \\nhe\\'s old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does , just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be . \\nwe learn of his accomplishments , which are quite impressive within their context , and when he complains about not being made top boss , it\\'s easy to sympathize with him . \\nnewell constantly plays up this aspect , making it a major theme which works well in the long run . \\nas donnie is constantly impressing and even one-upping lefty , it\\'s hard to tell which emotion is more powerful : the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob ; or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed . \\nmost of the film tells the story of donnie\\'s life in mafia , which creates for many sub-plots and individual conflicts , but doesn\\'t always seem to come together as a whole . \\nthe storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout , even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar . \\nthe resonance to donnie\\'s actual assignment varies , he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress , but it doesn\\'t always seem to have much meaning . \\nback home , his wife maggie ( heche ) is ready to divorce him because he\\'s never a and the family is suffering . \\nsince this is based on a true story i wouldn\\'t doubt this would happen , although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic . \\nmy only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act , or at least any real sense of closure . \\na climax of sorts does occur , but there\\'s little feeling of a payoff . \\nwe get a happy ending , which is good , but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful . \\naside from a few minor , general flaws , \" donnie brasco \" manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development . \\nit may be routine , but it\\'s good , and that\\'s respectful . \\n',\n",

\\nwill everyone in the town turn against the coach ? \\nwill the team win the climactic game ? \\ndo cats bathe themselves regularly ? \\nthe so-called \" hero \" in question is john moxin ( james van der beek ) , a senior at west canaan high school who plays for the varsity football team , but is really just hoping to get a scholarship at brown university so that he can get out of the dead-end town . \\nat least he\\'s got the right idea , since west canaan , texas is portrayed in the film as , frankly , pathetic , with the whole town treating the weekly football games as the second coming . \\nheck , in one scene , the front page of the town\\'s newspaper is proclaiming about the west canaan badgers\\' big win the night before . \\nwhen the team\\'s star quarterback is severely injured , tearing the ligaments in his leg , john finds himself taking over as the team\\'s leader , but his few minutes of glory do not last long , as he begins to have problems with his girlfriend ( amy smart ) when she discovers he spent an evening with another girl ( ali larter ) . \\nand after staying out all night with his drinking buddies at a strip joint ( all of the teenagers in the film are portrayed as raging alcoholics ) , the team loses their second-to-last game , putting john at feuds with the coach ( jon voight who , like gary oldman , is overstaying his welcome in the typecasted role as the \" bad guy \" ) . \\nworse yet , the coach is threatening to ruin john\\'s scholarship chances if the badgers don\\'t win their final game . \\nthe plotting of \" varsity blues \" is as old as the hills , and contains every cliche in the book . \\nadmittedly , i was never exactly bored while i was watching it , but i hasten to add that i was rarely ever entertained . \\nthroughout , all i could really think of is how virtually the same exact story had been filmed with a great deal more thoughtfulness and maturity in 1983\\'s \" all the right moves . \" \\none of the biggest problems i had with the film is how little of interest any of the characters actually were , least of all certainly not john , who , played by van der beek ( of tv\\'s \" dawson\\'s creek \" ) , is pretty much a bore without any engaging qualities . \\nwhile i probably shouldn\\'t blame this on van der beek , since the inauspicious and \" by-the-numbers \" screenplay by w . peter iliff isn\\'t of any help , he is still certainly not in the league of tom cruise in \" all the right moves . \" \\nthe story revolving around john , meanwhile , is extemely thin throughout , particularly for its 104-minute running time , and it alternates between uninspired comic relief ( as in when the students see their sex education teacher working as a stripper at the club ) and heavy-handed melodrama . \\nthe romance between john and his girlfriend had the potential to be an adequate subplot , but we also learned very little about her , which is unfortunate since amy smart , whom i don\\'t think i\\'ve seen before in past films , is probably the only character written with any sort of intelligence . \\nsmart does not allow her character to become the \" passive girlfriend , \" instead coming off as a young woman with her own ideas and opinions . \\nit\\'s too bad the camera didn\\'t linger on her long enough so we could hear some of those thoughts . \\nthe adult characters probably fare the worse of any , since they all must play residents of a dim-witted town that cares about nothing but football . \\njohn\\'s relationship with his parents can also be telegraphed far in advance . \\nhis father is set on him becoming a football player at a university , but john doesn\\'t want any part of that . \\nhis mother stands beside her \" big , strong husband \" and is a passive female . \\nfinally , jon voight plays the stock bully coach character and he does nothing to make the thankless role any more than one-dimensional . \\nsaving \" varsity blues \" from being a total washout are a few amusing sequences , including one set in the sex education class , which did get a laugh out of me . \\nthe scenes of playing football were well-shot and thankfully didn\\'t overstay their welcome , as many sports films fall victim to . \\nbut leaving the theater , the question i had in my mind was why did this film need to be made ?

              " 'a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal . \\na soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation-state against another . \\na common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain . \\na terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end . \\nif the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy , the violence continues . \\nit is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone ( even total innocents ) , anywhere , at anytime that gives the figure his label . \\nedward zwick\\'s the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states . \\nyou\\'d think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines . \\narab terrorists kill american citizens abroad , and the u . s . responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack . \\nhowever , unlike the real-life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden\\'s camp and manufacturing facility , the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal . \\nin retaliation , the terrorists bring the fight to the new world . \\nunwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent-in-charge anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , who works out of the bureau\\'s new york office at one federal plaza . \\nwhile investigating a series of bombings in the big apple , he encounters cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , also trying to uncover information . \\ngenerally , the fbi is charged with problems inside the u . s . , while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm . \\neven spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country . \\nhubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory , but as the two form a tentative professional relationship , hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government . \\nthe original tagline for patriot games was , \" there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil . \" \\nhowever true , it was pulled before the movie\\'s release because it sounded too much like a dare . \\nrevisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states , the siege is almost an invitation in itself , because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america . \\nadmittedly , the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive ( who\\'s going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two-thirds ? ) , but the basic premise is still valid . \\ni liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action-thriller fare of good guy g-men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order . \\nit provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab-american population , and that in an effort to find the terrorists , the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself . \\nin fact , about halfway through the film , when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city , the liberties of all americans are put at risk . \\nalthough it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign , the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups . \\nthroughout , the film maintains a conflict between hubbard , who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law , and general devereaux ( bruce willis ) , who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully . \\nwhat results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act , utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides . \\nit actually gets rather heady at times , but it\\'s a credit to screenwriters zwick , lawrence wright , and menno meyjes that they don\\'t underestimate the intelligence of the audience . \\ni don\\'t know if it\\'s his tone or inflection or something else , but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great . \\nthis , combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid-level authority figure , makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable . \\nannette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i\\'ve seen recently , and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable . \\nit\\'s somewhat unfortunate that her character\\'s fortitude is broken at a certain point , but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range . \\nbruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough-guy role , always standing straight , and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face . \\nhowever , the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film\\'s development . \\nnotable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad , a lebanese immigrant . \\nthe role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage , and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society . \\ndifficult to say the least , shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch . \\nperhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom \" wings , \" shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night . \\nwhereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick\\'s favorite actor ( he directed washington in glory and courage under fire ) , james horner seems to be his favorite composer . \\ni therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score-writer graeme revell ( seven films this year already ) over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian-themed music , and horner\\'s record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish-sounding at most . \\nrevell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole . \\nit\\'s nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we\\'ve been getting throughout the year . \\nmissteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes . \\nfor example , it\\'s pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick . \\nunfortunately , there\\'s a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions , obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye-catching . \\nin the middle of the city ( and against no real opposition ) , zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than 50 feet from friendly troops . \\nverisimilitude really goes out the window at that point . \\nthe film also gets a little preachy toward the end , focusing on the ability of different races to get along . \\na noble gesture , the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously . \\nthese flaws are glaring , but they don\\'t detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class . \\n',\n",

              " 'i suppose an argument could be made that toy story is one of those films that didn\\'t need a sequel . \\nbeloved by kids and their parents , respected equally by mainstream america and geekish movie buffs , that first movie remains a landmark of recent history , the one that burst open the possibilities of computer animation and demonstrated through wild invention and giddy chutzpah just how complacent the disney animation machine had become in cranking out fluffy razzle-dazzle entertainment full of formula storytelling and banal songwriting . \\nif disney was embarrassed at being beaten at its own game ( toy story was a smash hit of unexpected proportions , and one that caught the merchandising end of the business unaware as demand for action figures far outstripped supply ) , it didn\\'t show , and as distributor and part-owner of the property , at least it had a piece of the action . \\ntoy story 2 was greenlighted as a direct-to-video project , disney\\'s standard tactic for milking a few more bucks out of hot franchises without expending the effort of developing a proper feature film . \\nas someone who doesn\\'t believe sequels are necessarily a bad thing ( granted , they usually are a bad thing , but that\\'s because they\\'re made for the wrong reasons ) , i had to wonder what in the world they were thinking . \\nfortunately , disney claimed to have been so knocked-out by early animation tests that they let pixar go full-speed ahead with a theatrical sequel . \\nlucky thing , too -- like the first movie , this one is a joy to behold on the big screen , and technically , it improves on its predecessor on just about every level . \\n ( from a business standpoint , the end credits show that the new creations are copyrighted by pixar , while the previous film\\'s elements are shared between pixar and disney , a sign of the production house\\'s new cachet in hollywood . ) \\nvisually , the main shortcoming of this fully computer-generated movie is that human figures are still rendered relatively poorly , making them look a little creepy . \\nfortunately , that eerie unreality fits in perfectly with the perspective of the movie , where the secret world of toys is more immediate , and arguably more attractive , than the world of the humans who surround them . \\nas before , the story is predicated on the premise that the toys scattered around the bedroom of a little boy named andy -- and , indeed , all the toys scattered around the bedrooms of all little children -- come to life in the child\\'s absence . \\nwhile the toys scamper about and chatter endlessly among themselves , the real joy of a toy\\'s life is to mean something to its owner . \\none of the subjects of this new film is the sadness of toys that have been broken or abandoned , left on a shelf to gather dust , and another is the sort of emotional limbo inhabited by toys that are mere prizes of covetous collectors . \\nmost often , those toys are packed away in dark spaces , safe from sunlight and humidity , and often they\\'re not even removed from their packaging . \\nimagine what a chip that would put on your shoulder , and you\\'ll understand the attitudes of the collector\\'s items that show up in this movie . \\nsheriff woody ( voiced by a note-perfect tom hanks ) , the longtime favorite among andy\\'s toys who was challenged in the previous go-round by the arrival of flashy-new-thing action figure buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , suffers an injury early in the film , when andy tugs too hard on his arm and pulls a seam apart , revealing the stuffing inside . \\nthis accident catalyzes some uneasieness among the toys , who know too well that a broken toy is often a forgotten toy , and a forgotten toy is one that loses its reason for existence . \\nthose anxieties are crystallized when andy\\'s mom tears through his living room , collecting old toys for a yard sale . \\nand there\\'s an ironic twist to the tale , as woody winds up being stolen by an avid toy collector who needs exactly that quaint cowboy figure to complete a set that he hopes to sell to a japanese toy museum for a sizable sum . \\nthe rest of andy\\'s toys , who owe him quite a debt , resolve to rescue him . \\nthat this film manages to turn a box marked \" 25 cents \" into a symbol of doom , or to make its screed against the retention of collectible toys by wrongheaded profiteers fuel for a metaphysical dilemma , is a testament to its skill at metaphor , seamlessly translating the hopes and fears of our real world into that of the toys . \\noperating on this level of abstraction , toy story 2 tackles some mighty heavy issues without once preaching or veering into pretentiousness . \\n ( the worst i can say is that randy newman seems to have reserved his sappiest lyric in years for sarah mclachlan , who stops the movie cold by singing it at just about the halfway mark . ) \\nsometimes i think toy story 2 tries too hard . \\nthere\\'s somewhat less of the seat-of-the-pants loopiness that energized the first film , allowing it to surprise and excite on a near-constant basis , and more philosophizing about toys , collectors , the nature of happiness and the meaning of life . \\nwhile that leads to fewer bellylaughs , it does make way for more elaborate humor and an uncommonly ambitious reflexivity that asks the toys to consider their own status as commodities that move in and out of fashion . \\n ( just don\\'t ask why andy\\'s favorite toy is based on a tv series that was canceled in 1957 . ) \\nwhere else in mainstream movies do you get such an awesome moment as the one where buzz arrives at al\\'s toy barn to find it stocked to the gills with his doppelgangers , buzz lightyear action figures ? \\nforget the self-congratulatory science fiction of the matrix -- this is a fundamental mind-bender for buzz , and the audience shares his humility and wonderment at the sight . \\nhere , as in the roughly concurrent scene where woody watches tapes of the howdy doodyish children\\'s tv show that originated his character , we see our protagonists come face-to-face with god . \\nin sly ways , then , toy story 2 can be read as a film about mortality , a metaphorical consideration of aging and death . \\nsignificantly , the film\\'s very first sequence concludes with a grim shocker that had our opening-night crowd in a near-uproar . \\nand toward the end , when buzz and woody speculate on how long they have before andy grows up and discards his old toys , one of them observes , with an alacrity both inspirational and heartbreaking , that it will be fun while it lasts . \\nso toy story 2 joins the tradition of children\\'s stories , largely neglected of late , that say something real about the inevitable joys and tragedies of existence . \\nwhat\\'s really striking is that both toy story films ( and , to a lesser degree , pixar\\'s a bug\\'s life ) are kids\\' movies with wit and sophistication to shame most of their ostensibly adult counterparts , not to mention whatever piece of tot-friendly eye-candy is due from the disney dream factory any given summer . \\nit puts one in mind of the glory days of chuck jones and the old gang at warner bros . animation . \\ni\\'m not sure lasseter and his pals at pixar will ever operate at quite that level of purely visual invention -- they love traditional narrative too much -- but , boy , it makes me wonder what they might come up with next . \\n--------------------------------------------------------------

              " \"michael crichton has had a long career of writing novels , many of which are science fiction . \\nthe most profitable film adaptation of any novel was an adaptation of a michael crichton science fiction novel . \\nso in the logic of the film industry a good way to make a profitable film would be to make a big-budget adaptation of another crichton science fiction novel . \\ncongo failed , and i am afraid that sphere is probably not going to fare a whole lot better . \\nit a little better than just okay novel and it makes a film that is not even that good . \\nthe film is expensive , over one hundred million dollars ; is long , 133 minutes ; has a terrific cast , including dustin hoffman , samuel l . jackson , and sharon stone ; but has little that is really original and less that is exciting . \\nseveral years ago dr . norman goodman ( played by dustin hoffman ) was asked to write up a set of procedures for the government to follow if an alien entity was actually encountered . \\nthe plan he wrote was only semi-serious , but did explicitly define a team of experts who should investigate the alien . \\nnow that team has been assembled by a mysterious team leader named barnes ( peter coyote ) to study a spacecraft almost a half mile in length that apparently dropped into the pacific ocean in the early 1700s . \\nsuddenly norman's less than serious procedure has become an action plan for dealing with a real alien spacecraft . \\nincluded in the team to investigate are mathematician harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , biologist beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , and astrophysicist ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) . \\ntogether they travel to the deep pacific spaceship to understand its secrets . \\none major secret is the meaning of the huge sphere of gold-toned liquid metal at the heart of this spaceship . \\nwhat is disappointing about this film is that it does not have really effective performances . \\ndirector barry levinson is at his best with good actors rather than good special effects . \\nthe problem here is he is making a big-budget science fiction film . \\nit has some effects , but the most intriguing effect he shows only as an outline on a radar screen . \\nthe technique is to suggest rather than to show and let the actors and the viewer's imagination carry the film as robert wise did with the haunting . \\nthat could be a reasonable approach in a low-budget film . \\nbut that requires creating much more atmosphere than levinson can manage to muster . \\nit requires the actors to give really compelling performances and simply put , they don't . \\nhoffman's acting seems muted . \\njackson seems to laid back . \\nwe do not feel for these characters and do not get inside their heads . \\nlevinson paid big bucks for his actors and does not really get price performance . \\nand why we have queen latifah as a minor functionary on the expedition is anybody's guess . a \\ncast of unknowns could have delivered as much emotional impact at a fraction of the price . \\nlook how much more powerful a film like alien was with only moderate actors . \\nmost science fiction spectaculars these days have second-tier actors and first-tier special effects . \\nlevinson tries second-tier effects , and first-tier actors , but never makes that exchange pay off for the viewer . \\nperhaps sci-fi spectaculars are just not an actor's medium . \\nthe result gets a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n\",\n",

malcolm-as-momma schooling a pair of cocky teens in basketball ; malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments ; malcolm delivering a baby because big momma is the town midwife ( one of the few sequences that works ) . \\nmartin lawrence can be likeable enough at times , but there's no reason to care a whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm is never an independently significant character . \\nhe's just big momma without the makeup on . \\ni won't waste time commenting on how ineptly the set-up of the escaped convict is employed , since it was clearly a waste of time to the film-makers . \\nthere are a few token scenes of lester looming as a threatening figure , but he's ultimately a distraction in a film that's really about its central visual incongruity ( and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia long's posterior ) . \\ni'm never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people -- several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing -- but i know that when a film-maker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that it's an entire film , i duck out of the way . \\nthe gross implausibility of big momma's house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big , cleverly-constructed laughs . \\nits lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant . \\nbig momma's house is ridiculous _and_ not funny . \\nit's just a sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress . \\n\",\n",

              " ' \" mercury rising \" has numerous flaws , but there is one that really stands out : its central plot device is unnecessary . \\nthat\\'s right . \\nthe major aspect of the film , that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy / action flicks could be dropped from the beginning , and the movie would turn out exactly the same , if not better . \\nthis central device is the fact that a nine-year-old boy is autistic . \\nhis name is simon , and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it . \\nsimon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film , and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent , unfair world against his will , with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him . \\nthe fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of \" mercury rising . \" \\ni suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon\\'s character and his relationship with willis , but here it is lost . \\nmiko hughes , the young actor who plays simon , goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic : he walks slowly , drawls his words , kicks and screams when he\\'s touched , and has a hard time looking at other people . \\nit\\'s a difficult role for an adult , much less a young child , to play , and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn\\'t playing like he\\'s autistic . \\nunlike dustin hoffman\\'s performance in \" rain man \" or leonardo dicaprio\\'s in \" what\\'s eating gilbert grape , \" we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting . \\nhowever , unlike \" rain man \" which used its character\\'s autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story , \" mercury rising \" could go right about its generic , predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid . \\nhell , he doesn\\'t even have to be shy . \\nin fact , the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role , rather than just being carted around under willis\\' arm . \\nwillis\\' character , art jeffries , is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything . \\nhe becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simon\\'s house , where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide . \\nof course , we know that isn\\'t the way it happened happen because we saw an evil , square-jawed government hitman with a mean-looking crew-cut knock off the parents . \\nsimon was able to get away , and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet , which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked . \\njeffries -- who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it -- knows there is something more , and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon . \\nthis is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon\\'s parents is crawling everywhere , attempting to kill simon at the hospital , on the highway , and every other place he goes . \\nlate in the movie , jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey ( kim dickens ) who he meets at a coffee shop . \\nof all the hard-to-believe aspects of the movie , this is the worst . \\ni

him into her apartment at two o\\'clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him , and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent . \\nthe grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point . \\nthe movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences , but even here \" mercury rising \" doesn\\'t rise to the challenge . \\nthe movie was directed by harold becker , who has made some good suspense films including \" sea of love \" ( 1989 ) and \" malice \" ( 1993 ) , but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion . \\nthere is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman ( played by peter stormare ) that is so ineptly directed , shot and edited , that i had no idea 1 ) exactly where they were on the streetcar , 2 ) who was hitting who , and 3 ) where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were . \\nthe grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building , and features a harrowing ( yawn ) scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building , not because he has to , but because it\\'s more suspenseful that way . \\ntaken as a whole , \" mercury rising \" is an tepid , confused movie that lacks style , wit , and any traces of a sense of humor . \\nusually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles , but here he is too straight and serious . \\nthis is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time , but it ends up failing on both fronts . \\nmaybe the book was better , but the way it\\'s handled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore . \\n',\n",

              " 'much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of \" lolita , \" made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made , over its use of pedophilia , and as such , it\\'s important to address it straight-forwardly , before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed , as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years , lying around in vaults san a distributor , and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit . \\nwhen seeing this film , after all the hoopla , keeping in mind that there are people , namely me , who are fans of the novel , who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation . . . well , \\nyou just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution . \\nwhat\\'s even worse is that seeing this \" lolita , \" especially the first time and if you\\'re familiar with anything \" lolita , \" is admittingly very anticlimactic . \\nthis is a real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film , ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it , it\\'s really quite a film , perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne ( although , really , look at its competition : \" flashdance , \" \" fatal attraction , \" and \" indecent proposal \" ) , at least besides \" jacob\\'s ladder . \" \\ni\\'ve seen this \" lolita \" twice : the first time , i wasn\\'t so blown away . \\nit seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting . \\nthe second time , not really thinking about how i\\'ve waited for what seems like forever to see it and how i\\'m seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel and not a giant movie theatre , it really affected me emotionally . \\nthe story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one , which is why it\\'s such a good novel , and why this is such a good film . \\nthe story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14-year old girl named dolores a . k . a . lolita is great because it\\'s not trash for the perverted but because it\\'s about human obsession with things that are out of one\\'s reach . \\nits protagonist , the comically-named humbert humbert , is not your average pedophile , but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies . \\nthe character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology , something that will destroy us but that we can\\'t live without . \\nthese ideas are all worked into this film nicely , but done in a way that is not heavy-handed at all , but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating . \\nthe focus of this film , and the reason for making it , it seems , was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images , and scenes which are blatantly over-stylized . \\nthe tone of the book is a comical one , but it\\'s also a tragic one , and humbert , telling the story from his perspective , blows every single thing out of perspective . \\nhumbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions and desires , and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed . \\nwe get a sense that perhaps it\\'s by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed . \\nhe weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original 14-year-old love , and allows himself to embody her as lolita . \\nhe lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions , and by the end , he has nothing but overly-dramatic feelings for her . \\nthe story recognizes the extreme of this , almost out of a test , seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert , and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author , vladimir nabokov , wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions , and perhaps bring them to peace . \\nthe weirdest thing about this film is that by the end , when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey , we can easily sympathize and even identify with him . \\nthe opening and final images of the film are the same , and who hasn\\'t done a similar action , that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but a deep sadness in us ? \\nthis is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen , the first time being filmed in - shock - 1962 , by stanley kubrick , who couldn\\'t possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do , but did the next best thing : he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general . \\nin that film , he used the traps of society as benefits . \\nthe studio demanded the final scene , that of a heinous murder , come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile . . . and \\nwhen you see it , it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession . \\nthe censors wouldn\\'t allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the , um , relationship between humbert and lolita , so kubrick decided to play it as comedy , but still allow the tragedy to seep through . \\nlooking at these two versions , especially after reading the novel ( and we all know that when we\\'ve read a novel and see a film adaptation , we are bound to be angered by any size differences ) , it\\'s really impossible to compare them . \\nthey both go for different things , and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was . \\nand although it\\'s true that several scenes are similar , and are thus up for comparison , overall it\\'s unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse . \\ni have never been one for saying the level of greatness of a film adaptation of a novel is deemed by how faithful it is , and i won\\'t say that here . \\nhowever , this film is pretty amazing , mostly because hey , i loved the book , and this film nearly reminded me of it . \\nit doesn\\'t have nearly as much wit ( a couple comical scenes , and even a lot of good chuckles , but just not totally witty ) , but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had . \\nsome of that is in the casting of the two leads . \\njeremy irons , with his deep , soft british voice and gentle look , is an amazing humbert . \\nhe\\'s droll in a very unique way , and , well , no one can look distraught the way he does . \\nhe brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience . \\nand when he looks at lolita with love , and she looks at him with lust , you know that he\\'s her prisoner for as long as he lives . \\nand dominique swain , who plays the title character , is rather incredible . \\nshe pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original , wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction , bratiness , and self-centeredness that marks the character . \\nit\\'s easy to see why she surrenders to humbert : she loves the attention , and knows that she can have her way with him at any time . \\nwhen he denies her something , she blackmails him effortlessly ( a scene involving a rocking chair and a little foot action is damn near classic ) , and when he stands up to her , she weeps and runs away , leaving humbert to follow her . \\nthere are two other minor characters in the film , one who\\'s a road block in the beginning , and the other who\\'s a reappearing threat to the relationship . \\nthe former is charlotte , lolita\\'s mother , played by melanie griffith . \\nin the book , charlotte is a monster of a woman : overbearing , constantly scolding her child , overly-religious , and ultimately selfish . \\nand she\\'s the one obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal , at least in the beginning . \\nas played by shelly winters in the original , she represented all these qualities ; as played by griffith here , she\\'s about half of them . \\nit\\'s annoying to watch a film and play a game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first . \\nand even though griffith is not really bad , persay , she\\'s nothing more . \\nthe other is clare quilty , the writer who is also trying to seduce lolita , and succeeds , but at a price . \\nlangella takes a totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original . \\nquilty was a comic character in the original : a threat in the form of many forms , popping in states of rambling , german , proning , and eventually drunk . \\nlangella takes the other route , allowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed , and the result is a character who exists in shadows and low shots , and who meets a wonderfully ironic ending , the exact opposite of

              " 'contrary to the title , \" the boxer \" is not another rocky story only this time spliced with some cold hard politics . \\nit\\'s actually three movies in one : a political film , a boxing film , and a love story . \\nall of these work in their own respects and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt the three elements of the story , but somehow it seems kind of cliched and unoriginal . \\nwe\\'ve seen it all before , and we\\'re just not blown away with it like we should be . \\noh well . \\nit\\'s still an excellent irish story . \\n \" the boxer \" of the title is danny flynn ( jim sheridan staple daniel day-lewis ) , an ex-ira member who gets out of a belfast prison after 14 years , and finds out that his troubles are far from over . \\nfirst off , the ira is having a small civil war between its leader joe hamill ( brian cox ) , and one of its sub-leaders , harry ( gerard mcsorley ) , both having opposing views on getting many of their members out of jail . \\nwhile this is going on , danny and his old drunkard buddie , ike ( ken stott , who played the chief inspector in danny boyle\\'s \" shallow grave \" ) , re-open an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects , protestant and catholics , to work together . \\ndanny not only begins teaching kids how to box , but has stayed in great shape whilst in prison , and is ready to start boxing real people again . \\nand danny runs into his ex-love , maggie ( \" breaking the waves \" \\'s emily watson ) , who hasn\\'t seen him since he went in . \\nthey don\\'t easily start up their romance again because she\\'s the wife of a prisoner whom she married during danny\\'s tenure in prison , and also has a son , liam ( ciaran fitzgerald ) , from him , whom liam is hoping will get out soon . \\nbut the two are slowly re-drawn to eachother again , and this begins to complicate things . \\nthe political story is nothing really special but works in itself . \\nwe\\'ve seen it many a time before , but it\\'s at least interesting , sometimes emotional , and even riveting at times . \\nthere\\'s a big riot towards the middle of the film which is frightening in its brutality and honesty . \\nthe boxing story is very minor to the story , but does represent people coming together to fight eachother fairly , and even with good sportsmanship . \\nthere are only a few boxing scenes , but they\\'re never like \" raging bull \" /let\\'s-strip-down-the-sport-to-its-bones brilliant . \\nthey\\'re more realistic , and instead of bone crunching , we hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother , which is slightly unerving at times . \\nand i didn\\'t know daniel day-lewis was in such good shape . \\nbut the backbone of the story is the love one . \\nbecause these characters are given such horrible circumstances , and since the two leads have such great chemistry together , we really feel for their plight . \\nas the film goes on , and circumstances get worse and worse , the characters have to make real human decisions , and we can sympathize with them as humans not characters . \\nthis is how you write a love story - take note , hollywood . \\nthese elements are pretty much equally balanced , with each of the parts of the stories working hand-in-hand with eachother . \\ni loved how each of the different parts of the plot mattered , and sometimes spilled over into the next . \\nit made sure that we didn\\'t just care for one of them . \\ni\\'m not saying they\\'re all equally great , because the love story really carries the film , but at least they all work out respectively . \\nthe acting is amazing , with day-lewis and watson giving excellent performances and showing great chemistry . \\ni\\'m not sure if they\\'re oscar-nominee bound , but they\\'re very good . \\nin the supporting roles , billy cox is greatly sympathetic as the ira leader losing control of his daughter and his workers . \\nbut the film is stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike , who is just a great scene stealer . \\nthe direction and co-writing by jim sheridan ( with the other co-writing credit going to terry george ) is excellent , rounding out the characters well , but not pacing everything greatly . \\ni noticed that the first half was very leisurely ( yet fascinating ) , but the second half whirls by at a quick pace , and ends much too quickly . \\nmore time could have been spent thinking up the ending , since it does seem quite sloppy . \\nthough \" the boxer \" is a good film , it never achieves the greatness that it should . \\nsure , it\\'s a masterpiece compared to most of the hollywood drivel we usually get , but on it\\'s own , it just could have been better . \\nbut it still works out , gives us a great love story combined with a political and boxing drama , and features great acting . \\neven if it could have been better , this\\'ll do . \\n',\n",

social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood , and new authors filled the void , mostly by using hollywood\\'s financial and technical resources to create serious , \" personal \" or \" artsy \" movies . \\nas a result , audience , traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate , didn\\'t want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen . \\ngeorge lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue . \\nthe audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm , and huge financial success of the movie , later backed by supplement industry of toys , books , comics , role playing games and other merchandise , slowly began to change the face of hollywood . \\nserious , adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion , and were replaced by industrial products of \" blockbuster \" philosophy . \\none of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre . \\nuntil 1977 , science fiction movies were mostly in b-production domain . \\nin late 1960s , bigger budgets for science fiction didn\\'t look so strange anymore , thanks to the great success of 2001 : a space odyssey . \\nbut the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism , and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production - mostly dark , dystopic movies . \\nhowever , in 1977 star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies , even among the audience that usually doesn\\'t like it . \\nas a result , seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away , although some good , dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early 1980s . \\nafter that , science fiction continued to be considered a synonym for family entertainment . \\nironically , the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of \" new hollywood \" generation of young movie authors who made \" artsy \" and \" personal \" films in early 1970s . \\ngeorge lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx 1138 , and nostalgic drama american graffiti . \\nboth movies were considered \" personal \" in its time , despite latter one becoming very popular . \\nin a sense , star wars is an also very \" personal \" film , and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it , not for it . \\nbut unlike many \" personal \" movies of the era , its \" personality \" was in line with the wishes of the general audience . \\nthe plot , set \" a long time ago , in a galaxy far away \" , begins in a time of civil war . \\nthe evil empire is threatened by rebels who want to restore the old republic . \\nin order to quash any opposition , the empire had built death star , superweapon powerful enough to destroy whole planets . \\nthe information about death star , acquired by rebel intelligence , is being transported by princess leia organa ( carrie fisher ) when her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser . \\nprincess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader ( played by david prowse and voice by james earl jones ) , but the information is being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots - c3po ( anthony daniels ) and r2d2 ( kenny baker ) . \\nthose two robots are sold to the family of luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , young restless man who wants to leave his farm and become space pilot . \\nhis adventure begins when r2d2 escapes , because the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi ( alec guiness ) . \\nold man is actually the last surviving jedi knight , member of the ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force . \\nafter some hesitation , luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission to save the princess , while the old man would teach him the ways of the force . \\ntheir small band comes to the colourful spaceport of moss eisely , where they hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo ( harrison ford ) and his furry sidekick chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) . \\ncritics who don\\'t like the movie , especially those who can\\'t forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of \" new hollywood \" , are prone to point the lack of originality . \\non the surface , they might be right ; lucas himself admits that he found a lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood - westerns , wwii aviation movies , old sf cliffhanger serials of the 1930s and 1940s ; yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawa\\'s samurai classic the hidden fortress . \\non the other hand , those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further - into collective subconscious of western civilisation ( hinted by some mild tolkien references ) . \\nthe others would find the author\\'s element within the story - star wars could be seen as an anti- establishment film ; young , long-haired , easy going , nature-loving heroes are fighting against old , uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes . \\neven out of its historical or social context , star wars is an impressive as a strictly technical piece of the seven art . \\ngeorge lucas\\' direction is very good , with the clever editing and a well-paced segments between action and dramatic buildup . \\ncharacters are well-drawn and deliver all the necessary ingredients , both for the space opera and hollywood blockbuster . \\nwe have a \" coming-of-age \" hero , damsel-in-distress ( somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trends of the time ) , reluctant helper , benevolent mentor , diabolical villain and , finally , comic relief in form of two non-human characters . \\nsome of the actors are very good - alec guiness in his most famous role to date , james earl jones whose voice is enough to cause unease , peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form . \\nunfortunately , the same can\\'t be said for the main leads - among the main trio of mark hamill , carrie fisher and harrison ford , only the last one had the character three-dimensional enough to launch his further acting career . \\nthe thing that looked like the most important segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release was the new level of special effects technology . \\noften comparisons with 2001 : space odyssey , another ground-breaking sf film , were citing the sheer number of effects as a proof of the lucas\\' superiority over kubrick . \\nhowever , the special effects by john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive , even after two decades ( although 1997 special edition did improve them significantly ) , yet they aren\\'t the most remembered trademark of the movie . \\nthat honour should definitely go to the \" oscar \" -winning soundtrack by john williams , whose work on star wars is probably the brightest gem in his brilliant career . \\nnewer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of the enchantment that still holds those lucky enough to witness star wars original release . \\nyet , even if they are immune to the george lucas\\' magic they should watch this film nevertheless , perhaps only to become familiar with something that is essential part of contemporary culture . \\n',\n",

              " 'it stands as a moment one will not soon forget : a giant , green ogre flips through the pages of a cliche fairy tale , narrating it with every bit of dull inspiration that the story holds . \\nthis leads one to believe that this serves as the prologue to shrek , dreamworks\\' second computer animated feature , but in a pricelessly hilarious bit of cinema , a page of this tale serves as that ogre\\'s toilet paper . \\nfrom this opening moment , one can infer shrek\\'s defying of all expectations regarding it as a standard , disney-esque fairy tale . \\nalthough rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek , the true charm of the film lies in the bold elements of friendship , courage , and acceptance , excelled by outstanding direction , stunning actor voice work , and most importantly , a witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye . \\nwhile shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults , positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the storyline : shrek , the previously mentioned ogre , holds a position of absolute nothingness within his community . \\nthe jolly green giant meets a fellow outsider , known only as the donkey ( his species ) who talks , and although he remains reluctant to warm up to him for a good portion of time , shrek eventually comes to a mutual understanding with him by acknowledging their common state as outcasts of the world . \\nthe pair team up to retrieve princess fiona from a castle guarded by a dragon for the powerful lord farquaad , learning quite a bit about each other and themselves along the way . \\ntheir friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for someone to lean on , exemplifying to any child who may witness the film that acting as an honest companion can unquestionably affect someone . \\nshrek and donkey endure as supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others but cling to each other for support and guidance along their journey . \\ncourage demonstrates itself within two major storylines : along the journey to rescue fiona , donkey\\'s immeasurable cowardice reveals itself . \\nwhether he encounters walking over a shaky bridge or living alone , donkey withholds fears that he continuously puts aside without self-acknowledgment . \\nbut the yapping donkey must face his phobias when presented with the giant , fire-breathing dragon guarding fiona ; either he dies from terror or he triumphs with courage . \\nhe wisely chooses courage by pretending as if no dangerous situation actually faces him , allowing the donkey to overcome a horror that likely only continued due to his insistence of them . \\nsecondly , upon shrek\\'s and donkey\\'s redeeming of princess fiona , the ogre finds the princess has plans for whomever saves her : to satisfy her desire for a ( human ) knight in shining armor . \\nthroughout this storyline , shrek faces his deep , perpetual misgivings of inhering as an ogre and struggles to determine how he will reveal his true identity to fiona . \\nan ongoing struggle occurs between himself and his reluctance of the truth , but eventually , shrek courageously conquers his fear by telling the forbidden secret to fiona . \\nchildren can realize from donkey and shrek that fear remains only as complicated as one makes it ; if one sets his/her mind to overcoming something in particular , endless possibilities exist . \\nafter the friendships and courage prevail , the three central characters at the heart of shrek must take one more stretch of development : acceptance . \\nsurprisingly , fiona holds a dark secret of her own : due to a spell cast upon her years ago , she transforms into an ogre by night . \\nin this storyline , fiona must learn to hold acceptance for herself , and she must realize what beauty truly means : to simply act as one\\'s self . \\nupon fiona\\'s learning of shrek\\'s desire to pursue a relationship with her , fiona , knowing that acceptance of herself serves as the only platform for her love with shrek to work , gives in to her inner demons of self-ridicule and hatred . \\nany child can pull from fiona\\'s transformation the meaning of beauty and the meaning of self-acceptance . \\non the technical side , shrek triumphs . \\ndirectors adam adamson and vicky jenson pace shrek in a consistent and satisfying manner , evenly distributing the lessons learned by the central characters . \\nthese central characters spring to life thanks to brilliant voice work from mike myers ( shrek ) , eddie murphy ( donkey ) , and cameron diaz ( princess fiona ) . \\nmyers creates his shrek as a lovable and troubled ogre whose green color not only serves as a skin color but perhaps his envy of other , \" normal \" beings . \\nmurphy succeeds with his donkey through recreating the high-strung persona that so many know the actor to have off screen . \\ncameron diaz exudes charisma and innocence as fiona , giving the princess/ogre a sense of power that many female characters in animated films lack . \\nwhile the direction and voice work certainly elevate shrek , the ultimate factor in the film succeeding lies in the screenplay , written by ted elliott , terry rossio , joe stillman , and roger s . h . \\nschulman . \\nthe script never underestimates the intelligence of the viewer , combining the three previously spoken of elements with humor for adults and children alike . \\ncapping it off with a constant tongue-in-cheek feel that pokes fun at classic disney animated features , the fresh and entertaining screenplay delivers . \\nwith shrek , dreamworks executive jeffrey katzenberg has certainly one-upped himself by creating an instant animated classic that will live on for ages to come . \\nthe smaller children will laugh and cheer ; the adults will laugh even harder and leave understanding much that their children did not . \\na film that breaks stereotypes and creates a definite standard of its own , shrek can certainly endure as one for the ages . \\n',\n",

gebrecht ) and her self-absorbed , eccentric father ( schell ) . \\nher parents are survivors of the holocaust concentration camps , and her home life is filled with angst . \\nher mother is in denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything , while her father is more openly loving but has recently been absorbed in searching for two suitcases filled with mementos , a family album , silverware , and his old violin . \\nhe buried them in a garden during the war while fleeing the nazis , but can\\'t locate them now due to all the changes in the city . \\nout of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment , she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents\\' apartment building , mr . apfelschnitt ( topol ) , tells her about . \\nthe hasidics are ultra-orthodox : they don\\'t go to the cinema or watch tv , adhere to strict dress codes , and strictly observe their religious laws . \\nchaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules , but soon finds the wife , mrs . kalman ( rossellini ) , to be kind and she becomes attached to one of her 5 children , a 4-year-old named simcha ( monty ) who doesn\\'t talk . \\nthe stern mr . kalman ( krabb ? ) is not friendly to her and considers her to be a whore because of the way she dresses . \\nto hammer home the point of how anti-semitism hasn\\'t gone away there\\'s a barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering concierge ( bradley ) , who keeps making nasty remarks about jews and tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family from using the elevator . \\nthe film is done in by its ham-fisted script as the story , adapted from carl friedman\\'s book \" the shovel and the loom , \" goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality . \\nit starts off telling chaja\\'s story of how she\\'s a lost jewess trying to find her identity , then to her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an insulated environment , and then it makes it a story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that can\\'t be forgotten . \\nthe effort seemed heavy-handed , as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters . \\nthe supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring : chaja\\'s parents are given no human shades , while the janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was one-dimensional and falsely acted . \\nthe only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser , whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt -- but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots ; while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence , but is strong in accepting her faith . \\ntopol\\'s reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser , acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense . \\nthe film brazenly uses little simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it can\\'t love : it starts out by showing how under chaja\\'s loving care he\\'s taken to the duck pond and soon starts jabbering away , beginning by saying \\'quack , quack\\' and then going on to ask the four questions during a passover seder . \\nbut by showing how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence , refuses to speak because of his stern dad , and eventually becomes the victim of a tragic accident , the film thereby exploits the boy\\'s sufferings and his story just becomes tiresome and not sincerely done . \\ni felt i didn\\'t just see a movie , but i attended a lecture for the whole 100 minutes of this serious but unappetizing story . \\nit was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon , as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarily--the message it keeps sending was already received . \\nin the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage , one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past . \\nthat seems strange , since i thought that was what this film was supposed to be about . \\nunless i was mistaken and the film\\'s real aim was to make us cry over simcha . \\n',\n",
              " 'true faith and its expression through organized religion is a difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle head-on , which is probably why so few of them do it . \\neven the most religious directors - like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman - usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms . \\nso it\\'s not hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen years to get \" the apostle \" onto the big-screen . \\nas a matter of fact , even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing , and he ended up paying for it with $5 million of his own money . \\nhe also wrote the script , directed the film , and starred as the central character , a fiery texas preacher named euliss \" sonny \" dewey . \\nfew filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial , technical , and creative responsibility single-handedly , and it\\'s testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall . \\nand , thankfully , every bit of that personal investment translates on-screen into power and honest emotion . \\nsonny is an energetic , pentecostal preacher who has been speaking ( actually shouting ) from behind the pulpit since he was twelve . \\nhe spends much of his time traveling about the country , evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals . \\nunlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers , sonny is not a phony or a swindler , and the film\\'s purpose is not to unearth hypocrisy and sin in either sonny or the church . \\nduvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says , although like all humans , he has weaknesses . \\none of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that , not only does his long-suffering wife , jessie ( farrah fawcett ) , want to leave him for another man in the congregation , but the two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher . \\nfaced with the loss of two things he loves passionately- his church and his family - that same raw power that allows sonny to get entire congregations rocking and swaying transforms into a violent temper . \\nat his son\\'s baseball game , sonny snaps and smashes his wife\\'s lover in the face with a baseball bat , inflicting a wound that may be fatal . \\nnot knowing what else to do , sonny disappears . \\nhe throws away his identification , drives his car into a lake , and takes a bus to louisiana , hoping to start over again . \\nin the tiny , mostly poor coastal town of bayou boutte , sonny once again finds his calling . \\nafter befriending a simple auto mechanic ( walt goggins ) and tracking down the town\\'s ex-minister ( john beasley ) , sonny sets up his own church , the one way to heaven temple . \\nre-christening himself as \" the apostle e . f . , \" he quickly draws together an eager congregation , and together they realize real change in each other\\'s lives . \\nbut , always , sonny\\'s past is lurking a step behind him , waiting to swallow his progress . \\nduvall has made his intentions in making \" the apostle \" clear . \\nin a recent article in \" newsweek , \" he wrote : \" filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality with such a strong emphasis on the holy spirit , and when they do , it tends to be patronizing - full of charlatans and snake handlers . . . \\nbut what i really wanted to do was try to understand what these preachers go through and what they believe , and to portray it in an accurate way . \" \\nthe strength of duvall\\'s convictions turn out to be the strength of his film - \" the apostle \" always rings true , even in the most painful moments , because we know he\\'s being sincere with the subject matter . \\nafter fifteen years of traveling the country , listening to all shapes and sizes of ministers and taking studious notes on what they said , duvall has captured the energy and vitality of what it means to be truly spiritual . \\nhis sonny is a man who speaks directly to god and expects to be spoken right back to . \\n \" i\\'ve always called you jesus and you\\'ve always called me sonny , \" he says . \\nwhen neighbors call and complain that he is being too loud one night in one his rants with the man upstairs , sonny\\'s mother ( june carter cash ) just hangs up on them because she knows there\\'s no sense trying to interrupt him . \\nthe main theme to emerge from \" the apostle \" is the fact that good can come from any situation . \\nsonny\\'s act of violence toward another human being is inarguably a horrific thing , and duvall never shrinks from that fact . \\nhowever , that very same act of violence is what brings sonny to bayou boutte , where he finds people whom he desperately needs and who desperately need him . \\nin his short time in louisiana , he does a world of good , and when the police finally show up to take him away , he goes quietly , knowing that he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him . \\nand , as a scene during the final credits shows , he even turns his punishment into a positive opportunity for change and betterment . \\nit is that strength in sonny\\'s character that makes him so appealing and magnetic to others - he is flawed , but he is powerful enough to overcome those flaws . \\nweak men are the ones who simply accept their weaknesses and lack the desire to better themselves . \\nwatching duvall on-screen , it\\'s not hard to imagine that he would have been a magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation over acting . \\nas sonny , he completely inhabits the character , and his performance is certainly the best of the year . \\nbecause he spent so much time absorbing the traits , methods , quirks , and personalities of real preachers , duvall was able to create a complete character who always feels indelibly human . \\nas a director , duvall feels that less is more . \\nhis camera simply takes in what goes on in front of it , with very little intrusion . \\nthere are no fancy crane shots or extended dollies or excessive close-ups . \\nduvall knew that the power of the film\\'s characters ( enhanced by the fact that he cast mostly non-professional churchgoers and actual ministers ) didn\\'t need to be artificially enhanced . \\nin this way , \" the apostle \" almost plays out like a documentary , not only in its technical simplicity , but more importantly , in its sense of reality . \\n',\n",

\" \\nand so , as a critic , i\\'m already responsible to ask that same question . \\njackie brown stars pam grier , the \" blaxploitation \" heroine from the 1970\\'s , who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character . \\ntarantino\\'s pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta\\'s sudden revival in the movie industry , and with talks of an oscar nomination , the same is likely to happen for grier . \\n ( we\\'ve made it thru comparison #1 ! ) jackie is a 44-year-old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash , and probably her main revenue , by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie ( pulp fiction\\'s samuel l . jackson and comparison #2 ) . \\nordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara ( robert de niro ) , a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years , to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half- million dollars . \\ntrouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) and taken into custody for possession of narcotics , as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed . \\nnaturally this proves an obstacle to ordell\\'s plans and , not as friendly intended as we\\'d hope , he posts jackie\\'s bail after she is put behind bars . \\nthe thing is , ordell is in this for no one more than himself , and as we learn from his previous actions , he\\'s willing to kill anyone who stands in the way . \\njackie finds herself in a tight squeeze . \\nordell won\\'t think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she\\'s always done , yet at the same time , a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided . \\nit comes down to a simple question : would jackie rather face ordell or prison ? \\nwhat ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help : the law , ordell , or maybe just herself . \\ncoming into play is another 70\\'s veteran , robert forster as jackie\\'s bail bondsmen max cherry . \\nmax\\'s obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system , and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance . \\nalso involved is ordell\\'s \" surfer girl \" girlfriend melanie ( bridget fonda ) , a ditzy sun- bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand . \\nfonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role , but there\\'s nothing more to her , and therefore , she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters . \\nde niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself . \\nde niro is a brilliant actor , but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn\\'t need a de niro to play him . \\ncompared to pulp fiction ( comparison #3 ) , the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable . \\nin pulp fiction , even the small , seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful , complete , and lifelike , whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn\\'t have suffered much with a lesser talented cast , the exception being grier . \\ntarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind , so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth . \\nsadly , grier too could have received a bit more attention , especially when the story is all about her newly-jarred perception of life . \\njackson teams up with tarantino again , but the chemical reaction isn\\'t as awesome as the first time . \\njules was the rambling , bible-quoting hitman in pulp fiction , and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off . \\nand although jackson is really , really good in jackie brown , i don\\'t think he\\'s quite as irreplaceable . \\nin fact , maybe a new face would have been better . \\njackson could\\'ve remained tarantino\\'s jules , and a new guy could have become ordell , forever to remain so in our memories . \\nsadly , these characters are too much the same , except ordell just isn\\'t as impressive , and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules . \\nanother problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning . \\nthis is grier\\'s film , so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses ? \\nit not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted , but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story . \\nit is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino\\'s quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style , and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard\\'s novel \" rum punch \" . \\nfor those movie-goers , don\\'t expect another pulp fiction and you\\'ll be satisfied , for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of 90\\'s film- making . \\nthe directing has toned down a bit , however , yet we\\'re still reminded that this is tarantino\\'s movie thanks to odd split-screen story-telling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints . \\nso getting back to the question that i began with , this isn\\'t pulp fiction at all . \\nit\\'s good , but it isn\\'t anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place . \\nthis is a more conservative tarantino , but not one that won\\'t satiate true fans . \\nif you can realize that this isn\\'t going to knock your socks off , then you\\'ll be happy to at least let it massage your feet . \\nafter all , we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy . \\n',\n",

              " 'it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival\\'s palme d\\'or , a $100 million-plus box office gross , and an oscar nomination ? all for his sophomore outing , pulp fiction . \\nsince then , the talented film maker has been virtually invisible , surfacing briefly as a co-director of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire-fest , from dusk till dawn . \\nin between , he has moonlighted as an \" actor \" with several decidedly unmemorable performances . \\nnow , with much fanfare and anticipation , tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort , jackie brown . \\nand , while this motion picture , adapted from elmore leonard\\'s novel , rum punch , offers solid entertainment , those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed . \\nfor the most part , jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie . \\nthe story , which starts out slowly , develops into a twisty affair , with double-crosses and triple-crosses . \\nand the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks : witty dialogue , unexpected gunfire , \\'70s pop tunes , and close-ups of womens\\' bare feet . \\nyet , for all of that , the production is something of a letdown . \\nthe sheer , in-your-face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent . \\nthe mostly-straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn\\'t match up favorably to the non-linear style of tarantino\\'s previous efforts ? an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives . \\nand there aren\\'t nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around . \\nthere\\'s a samuel l . jackson monologue about guns , a jackson/chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk , and a jackson/robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson/travolta material from pulp fiction , but that\\'s about it . \\njackie brown\\'s lone \" innovation \" is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives . \\nthis isn\\'t exactly an original technique ? it has been done numerous times before , most famously in akira kurosawa\\'s rashomon and most recently in edward zwick\\'s courage under fire . \\nhowever , while in those two movies ( and others ) , there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points-of- view , tarantino\\'s sole purpose for using it appears to be because it\\'s unconventional . \\nhad the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages , nothing would have been lost . \\nas a result , this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity . \\nfor the second picture in a row , tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a \\'70s icon . \\nthis time around , instead of john travolta , it\\'s blaxploitation queen pam grier ( foxy brown has become jackie brown ) . \\nin one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier\\'s career , tarantino uses a \\'70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits . \\nthere are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre ( although grier never does any butt-kicking ) . \\ngrier is jackie brown , a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states . \\nshe\\'s working for gun dealer ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning , despite pressure from ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , a federal official . \\nno longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie , ordell arranges for a bail bondsman , max cherry ( robert forster , tv\\'s \" banyon \" ) to post the necessary $10 , 000 , then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal . \\njackie passes ordell\\'s test , however , and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 of ordell\\'s money into the united states without tipping off the feds . \\nsoon , just about everyone is after that money , including jackie , max , ray , ordell\\'s perpetually oversexed and drugged-out girlfriend , melanie ( bridget fonda ) , and his right-hand man , louis ( robert de niro ) . \\nunsurprisingly , the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l . jackson , but ordell isn\\'t nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction . \\nin addition to looking fantastic , pam grier is also quite good , although hers is not an oscar- caliber performance ( although she might get a nomination ) . \\nrobert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough-guys-who-rarely- smile roles . \\nbridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons : to look sexy in a bikini , to provide a little twisted comedy , and to satisfy tarantino\\'s foot fetish . \\nrobert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy- looking , middle-aged actor . \\nthe film , which clocks in at several minutes over the two-and-a- half hour mark , is probably too long for the material , but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout ( although the payoff is a letdown ) . \\ntarantino keeps things moving along nicely , with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction , but , on the whole , this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself . \\nwhen it comes to recent caper films ( like the grifters and bound ) , jackie brown is a second-tier effort . \\nit\\'s an entertaining diversion , but not a masterpiece , and certainly not an oscar contender . \\n',\n",

              " 'known as the most successful , highest-grossing romantic comedy in history , director garry marshall apparently struck gold with \" pretty woman , \" which opened quietly during the summer of 1990 but , thanks to positive word-of-mouth , was able to reach upwards of $175-million in theaters alone . \\nthe question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film\\'s two charismatic stars , richard gere and julia roberts , since the story itself is none too original or even believable . \\nthe other winning element that makes \" pretty woman \" so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence , which is rarely as palpable in today\\'s films as it is here . \\nedward lewis ( richard gere ) is a suave , extremely wealthy business mogul who , at the start of the picture , breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument , and abruptly takes his friend\\'s car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel . \\nstopping the car along the street , he asks a woman , obviously a prostitute , for directions . \\nagreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks , edward ultimately accepts , they strike up a conversation , and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor . \\nthis meeting does not lead to sex , however , as edward confides that he\\'d rather just have someone to talk to , and offers her $300 to spend the night . \\njust as well , since the hooker , named vivian , is a beautiful , generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear . \\nthe meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned , when edward finally offers to pay vivian three-thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area , keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and get-togethers . \\nsince vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips , which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers , the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act , edward and vivian will finally , truly , kiss . \\nallegedly planned as a grim , downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director , \" pretty woman \" has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale , a la \" cinderella . \" \\nthe premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been . \\nyou honestly don\\'t need a high-iq ( or any iq , for that matter ) to guess how the film will end , and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha . \\nthe supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less-than-gratifying , and the screenplay is no award winner . \\nand yet , amidst all of these qualms and flaws , \" pretty woman \" is an astoundingly charming motion picture , and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers . \\nyou\\'d actually be amazed how far bemusement can go , and there are a few select moments ( not even whole scenes , mind you ) that are as romantic as anything i\\'ve seen on film in the 1990\\'s . \\nadditionally , the film belongs , and its success can be attributed , to two people and two people only , and they are richard gere and julia roberts . \\nplaying sex symbols throughout the \\'80s with such pictures as \" american gigolo \" and \" an officer and a gentleman , \" gere branches out here to play a more quiet , almost shy , but still alluring , character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet , and vice versa . \\njulia roberts , in her breakthrough role after 1988\\'s well-received \" mistic pizza \" and 1989\\'s \" steel magnolia , \" for which she was nominated for an academy award , is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian , who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers , not for her line of work , but more for her sheer intelligence . \\nit would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake , but screenwriter j . f . lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing . \\nafter \" pretty woman , \" roberts , along with meg ryan , became the reigning queen of romantic comedies ( with her latest being the just-released \" runaway bride , \" which repairs gere and roberts together once again ) , and no wonder . \\nroberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy , but also one who can efficiently do drama , and in almost every film she appears in , it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male co-star . \\nan especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co-workers that vivian is actually a prostitute , and he then approaches her , making sexual advances . \\nno only does this make vivian feel cheap , especially since she had previously been posing as a more professional , eloquent young lady , but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way , and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading , and if she likes this particular path . \\non the more dreamy side , the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold , especially one in which edward enters into the hotel\\'s lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress , but also her inner ( and outer ) glowing beauty . \\nanother subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward , who is asleep , and placing it on his lips , since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days . \\n \" pretty woman \" does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene , which is a happy ending ( as you\\'d expect , and wouldn\\'t have it any other way ) that somehow does not work , perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances . \\nthis one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film , though , because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem . \\nhelped along by a warm , memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo , as vivian\\'s best friend and roommate , and a fabulously catchy soundtrack , in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movie\\'s overall fulfillment , \" pretty woman \" is a sparkler of a motion picture , and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy . \\n',\n",

more was his rigorous physicality , which he effectively practices almost all throughout the films 93 minutes . \\nalthough the film is blotted with a couple of portentous action sequences ( very well done ) yet the tightness is generated by the subtle circumstances this man is presented with . \\nfaced with an enigma about his wife's whereabouts , the movie succeeds by conveying us in realistic territory with veritable characters , including the cryptic villains , who in essence , make the movie what it is . \\nwhat's most impressive however , is the feature debut by writer/director jonathan mostow . \\nmostow , hitherto directed the showtime thriller flight of a black angle , alleviates the contrivances and generics of the script by gingerly pursuing the trajectory of the plot , efficiently letting the tone and the mood of the story generate that nail-biting suspense sought for in a well- made affair . \\ncontrary to most american thrillers , he doesn't rely on visual flair , but on aesthetics and substance . \\nafter breakdown , he should gain vast notoriety . \\nthe villains in the movie aren't your routine out-of-this-world idiosyncratic psychos that are harming for no particular objective . \\nthe baddies in breakdown , all well acted , are normal , seemingly inoffensive townspeople who beneath their trustworthy layer , conduct an amoral business of corruption and murder . \\nthe movie smartly portrays these men as loathsome rednecks , and , of all things in the world , it is becoming rather easy to root for villains ( jon voight in anaconda ) in today's movies . \\nworth a special mentioning is j . t walsh ( who previously worked with kurt russell in executive decision ) as the leader of the gang , he renders a deliciously wicked performance , temporarily stepping out of the minor roles he is known for . \\nalfred hitchcock used suspense--and action-- not only to stimulate , but as a way of aiding his audience's fascination in his stories , which were slowly realizing man's biggest fears . \\nbreakdown yields exactly that . \\nit magnificently taps into the psyche of an ordinary man , acting like an ordinary man , looking like an ordinary and some sort of superhero . \\ndespite one or two iffy moments even hitchcock , i think , would approve of breakdown . \\n ( 1 : 33 ) \\n\",\n",
              " 'people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels , stories , comic books or movies . \\noften science fiction aficionados find material , previously labelled as science fiction , to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror , or rather simple techno-thriller . \\nin such cases , mistakes are understandable - genre boundaries are never clearly marked . \\nbut , i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic . \\nsuch thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago , when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff , 1983 film directed by philip kaufman . \\nthe mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits . \\nbut the right stuff film isn\\'t even fiction . \\nit was based on the non-fiction book by tom wolfe , covering the early years of american space program . \\nthe plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base , major test site for experimental planes . \\nthe major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier . \\nmany pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado . \\nbut one quiet pilot , chuck eager ( played by sam shaped ) succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots , determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records . \\nten years later , soviets have launched \" sputnik \" marking the beginning of the space age . \\nin order to regain national prestige , us government decides to be the first to send man into space . \\nbest air force , navy and marine pilots are recruited into program , but not yeager , because he lacks college education and desired all-american image . \\nin one of critics\\' polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s . \\nsuch high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman\\'s film looks quite atypical for its time . \\nwith more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s - age when hollywood used to make films larger than life . \\nbut the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker . \\nphilip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original , memorable movies . \\nthe right stuff was the last of them , swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual , risk-taking \" artsy \" projects . \\nthe right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film . \\nthe plot is almost non-existent and not very coherent ; the story , featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes , shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots , embodied in yeager , to new generation of the astronauts . \\nthe film also lacks conventional protagonist - yeager ( who also appears in small cameo ) remains the true hero of the film , but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives , making this movie into ensemble piece . \\nthat gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents , until that specialised only for bit or character roles . \\nsam shepard is great as yeager , war hero whose greatest achievement - breech of the sound barrier - remained obscured in history books , probably due to his own modesty . \\non the surface , he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues , but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases . \\nshepard\\'s performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean-cut marine ( and future politician ) john glenn . \\nyoung dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper , and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom , superbly played by fred ward . \\nalways reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and ( arguably ) first american man in space alan shepard . \\nkaufman left room for female talents to excel too - barbara hershey , pamela reed , veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots\\' wives . \\nroyal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher , but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice-president lyndon b . johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch . \\ngreat acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman\\'s superb direction . \\nmost notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time . \\nthe beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert , as virtual unknowns , far away from strict rules and discipline . \\neverything seems natural -yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world . \\nin that setting , it\\'s quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights . \\nbut the times are changing ; ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war , and \" natural \" pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined , conventional pilots . \\ntheir entire lives become focus of media frenzy , and their job is subjected to strict rules , meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats , publicity-seeking politicians and uncaring scientists ( like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun , played by scott beach ) only to preserve their most basic human dignity . \\nthis contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence - while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity , \" mercury \" astronauts receive fame and fortune , although some of them even before going in the space . \\nthose contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman\\'s superb use of poetic movie language . \\nediting is great , and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion ( the same image would be copied in many latter films ) . \\nalthough kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military , which provided authentic locations and period equipment , he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights . \\nthose effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space . \\nanother fine contribution of this film is \" oscar \" -awarded musical score by bill conti ; i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it . \\nit is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy . \\nsome of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period . \\nthis film is great , and its cult status is well deserved , but there are some minor flaws . \\nsome of the \" mercury \" astronauts aren\\'t fleshed out enough ( although being played by fine actors , like lance henriksen ) . \\nfilm also lacks proper closure . \\non the other hand , most logical conclusion of the film - landing on the moon - would require this film to be more than six hours long . \\nalso , some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians , who were portrayed as evil monsters , just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan\\'s america . \\nin some of contemporary interviews , kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible , and in order to do that , he portrayed russians not as they were in real life , but as they were perceived by americans in early 1960s . \\ntime has passed ; now we don\\'t see astronauts as heroes . \\nin this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions , those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers . \\nfew young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up . \\nbut this film , sentimental reminder of the times \" when future began \" , perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow \" mercury \" astronauts\\' footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky . \\nand even if they decide to stay on earth , they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema . \\n',\n",

) . \\nso back we are , with ripley back as a clone , which means we get another little satirical look at cloning ( not that that\\'s a bad thing , but it\\'s becoming a cliche ) . \\nso she\\'s cloned aboard an even more futuristic-looking ship called \" the auriga \" by some doctors ( including the necessary bad government guy , dr . wren , played by j . e . freeman , as well as the little-seen dr . gediman , played by none other than brad douriff ) , mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her . \\nonce you get past the fact that you can\\'t figure out where they got her blood ( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one ) , the film\\'s okay . \\nalso on board are a band of mercenary pirates , including michael wincott , ron perlman , kim flowers , raymond cruz , dominique pinon ( a jeunet sytable ) and . . . winona ryder , who plays analee call , who turns out to have a bit of a secret ( i won\\'t state it , but unless you\\'ve been shacking up with salinger for the past two years , you probably know all about it - although it\\'s nicely covered up ) . \\nthere\\'s a bit of a non-sexual-yet-slightly-homoerotic relationship between her and ripley , but it\\'s never really deepened enough . \\noh well . \\nwell , as you might have guessed , the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship . \\nand it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship ( including some shocks - dan hedaya , for instance , who\\'s death is comical yet sad since , well , he\\'s dan hedaya ) , and the remaining people ( about 7 or 8 ) are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth . \\nof course , the plot is all balderdash , and just an excuse for some good old \" alien \" -brand fun . \\nthe real focus of the series seems to be on style , not really substance ( although there\\'s always a bit of it , most notably in \" aliens \" with the relationship between ripley and the little girl ) . \\nwhat\\'s interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach . \\n \" alien \" is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights . \\n \" aliens \" is a wild , tense thriller . \\n \" alien 3 \" is a bleak , moody piece of semi-noir . \\n \" alien 4 \" is kind of like an off-beat french film , filled with lots of humor , and cool scares . \\njean-pierre jeunet ( without his usual directing partner , marc caro ) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like \" das boot \" has , with echoes hinting at a possible threat . \\nthe chills in the film are really cool , especially with the music , which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes ( there\\'s the most tense surgery scene since \" face/off \" towards the beginning ) . \\nand not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that . \\nthis all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others . \\nthere are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed . \\none is the aforementioned surgery scene . \\nanother one takes place between call and ripley , which is just awesome . \\nthe underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense , thrilling , and jaw-dropping scenes in the entire saga ( with a small allusion to jeunet\\'s earlier film , \" delicatessen \" ) . \\nand the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool ( with a lovely allusion to \" goldfinger \" ) . \\nbut the best scene in the entire film ( i\\'m sure i\\'m not the first to mention it ) takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her ( she has a an \" 8 \" tatooed on her arm ) . \\nit might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga . \\nthe screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work , as it never really deapens a lot of the characters . \\nhowever , it does make us care about most of them , so that when there\\'s very little of them , and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow , we are pretty scared . \\nand , yeah , there are some very funny lines ( ripley : \" who do i have to fuck to get off this boat ? ! \" \\njohner : \" well , i can get you off . \\nbut not this ship . \" ) \\nthe acting is good all around , with stand-out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner , and leland orser ( the poor bastad in \" se7en \" who performed the \" lust \" sin ) as an anxiety-ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him . \\nwinona ryder is good , but not amazing like she usually is ( although she meshes well with the film ) . \\nof course , and as usual , sigourney weaver steals the show . \\nplaying a variation on the ripley character ( less emotional , and more rude and bitter ) , she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable . \\nshe\\'s not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for \" aliens , \" but she\\'s just awesome . \\noverall , it\\'s a thrilling , entertaining film which doesn\\'t really amaze like the first two , but is much more amazing than the third installment . \\nthe style is the best part of the film , which isn\\'t really a bad thing , but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply . \\nbut it\\'s entertaining as hell , and it\\'s definitely fit for the \" alien \" series . \\n',\n",

setting is immediately established . \\ninterior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers . \\nthe hamlet castle\\'s grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings , mirror-panel doors , and bridges which connect opposite sides of a second-story loft . \\ncostuming is equally grand , drawing upon both history and imagination . . \\nnot quite the denmark of the 1600\\'s , the characters\\' attire is something of a cross between that era and turn of the century russia , very effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel . \\nit is not surprising that tim harvey and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction and best costume design oscars , respectively . \\nin addition to directing , kenneth branagh also plays the title character . \\nas the revenge-driven royal heir , branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs and lows . \\nfrom the anticipation of seeing his father\\'s ghost , to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester , to his eventual wrath , branagh delivers in spades . \\nevery scene truly revolves around hamlet , as much a tribute to branagh\\'s acting and directing as to shakespeare\\'s manuscript . \\nhamlet seems to be a who\\'s who of shakespearean-trained actors , so watching them perform the craft for which they have much love is a delight in itself . \\njulie christie , as hamlet\\'s mother gertrude , and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly , as do many of the supporting players . \\nkate winslet as hamlet\\'s lover ophelia , does an outstanding job demonstrating the character\\'s plummet to the depths of dispair and madness . \\nrichard briers as ophelia\\'s father , polonius , and michael moloney as her brother , laertes , are equally convincing . \\nnicholas farrell as hamlet\\'s trusted friend horatio , and timothy spall and reece dinsdale as the two-timing rosencrantz and guildenstern round out the excellent core cast . \\nhamlet also seems to be a film in which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible . \\nin some cases , this made for interesting scenes . \\nbilly crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick , whom hamlet knew quite well . \\ncrystal proves himself able to deliver the lines with both the timing of a classic actor and the verbal countenance of a comedian , and the result is a very funny scene . \\nhowever , charleton heston , whom many might think would butcher shakespeare , is the biggest surprise of all . \\nas the player king , the leader of a troupe of traveling actors , he is absolutely breathtaking when narrating the story of priam and hecuba . \\npart of his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment of the story ( with sir john gielgud and judi dench ) , but this is most unfortunate , for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time . \\nhis off-camera speaking , while gripping , sort of downplays the scene to a narration done by any other well-voiced actor . \\ni wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene which heston lays out , and let the venerable actor have the attention . \\nunfortunately , there were some casting choices which led to poor distractions . \\njack lemmon , an excellent actor , just can\\'t do shakespeare . \\nas marcellus , the guard who sees the elder hamlet\\'s ghost , lemmon sadly underperforms and is shown up left and right by those around him . \\ngerard depardieu , another talented actor , is wasted when given little more than the utterances of \" yes , my lord \" and \" no , my lord \" in the role of reynaldo . \\nrichard attenborough has a ( literally ) walk-on role , showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador . \\ni think he had two lines . \\nthen there is rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway . \\nwhen i went to see dangerous beauty earlier this year , two ladies behind me kept commenting about how handsome he was . \\nif bulging eyes are your idea of handsome , well i guess comic actor marty feldman was some kind of sex symbol to you . \\nhamlet is a complicated tale of treachery and revenge in which triumph and defeat become one . \\nbranagh attempts to help us out with some of the intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashback-type images . \\nthis only works about half the time , and i wonder if it would have been just as well to do without them . \\nyou don\\'t have to be some kind of genius to appreciate shakespeare , but it is quite difficult to understand unless you have the time to read or hear it carefully and repeatedly . \\nthe alternate method of comprehension is that with which most of us are familiar , the high school english course . \\nin it , you are hopefully fortunate enough to have an educator willing to help you with the plot points and nuances essential to understanding a play written in the rigmarole known as the king\\'s english . \\nor i suppose you could just read the cliff notes .

the fresher , the better . \\nwhen horner scouts a fresh faced stud bussing tables at his favorite discotheque , he decides to add him to his stable . \\nit is a pairing that leads to a meteoric rise and fall for a young man reaching his prime and an old man rapidly speeding past his . \\nas directed by anderson , the camera moves through many of the scenes with an eerie omnipresence and an almost childlike curiosity to peer beyond the closed door . \\nboogie nights provides a voyeuristic peep into the underbelly of l . a . \\'s hardcore film scene . \\nbut the peep show doesnut let us walk away when the titillation ends . \\nthe downside of voyeurism is sometimes we end up seeing things we wish we hadnut . \\nby the film\\'s final image , what we we once found titillating has now become a grim reminder of the vanity of fame and the high price of realizing your dreams . \\nboogie nights is not about sex . \\nit does not glorify porn or the lifestyles of the performers . \\nin fact , the film isn\\'t really about pornography at all . \\npornography is merely the setting to tell a compelling story about a lost and forgotten group of people who form their own sub-culture to find acceptance of who they are . \\nthe film goes to brilliant , often hilarious and sometimes harrowing lengths to show us that the people who choose to produce or perform in these films are generally not all that bright and lack the basic tools to function in the mainstream world . \\nyet , like in the lauded tarantino films , these people still have their own moral code , their own concepts of integrity and their own needs to experess themselves creatively . \\nthe characters we meet are like a road map of dysfuntion . \\nfirst stop , the den mother ( julianne moore ) in denial about her addiction to cocaine as she tries to retain custody of her son . \\nsecond stop , the cuckold crewman ( william h . macy ) who keeps discovering his wife having sex with anyone and everyone ( the wife is played in hilarious cameos by real-life porn star nina hartley ) . \\nbut the driving force behind the plot is 17 year old eddie adams . \\neddie is blessed with a natural endowment so famous that people actually pay just to see it . \\nwith no real ambition of his own , he hooks up with jack horner to fullfill his destiny of fame . \\nhis alcoholic mother , clearly dissatisfied with her own lot , abuses him verbally and drives him out of the house . \\nhorner introduces him to amber waves ( moore ) who immediately adopts him , a nuclear family is born . \\nthe surrogate relationship that develops between amber waves and her \" babies \" provides some of the films most poignant scenes . \\nclearly , she is not even fit to manage her own life , let alone nurture these lost children . \\nbut the need to love and be loved is so strong , they easily ignore the dangers of the less subtle addiction she introduces them to . \\neven the viewer is somehow lulled into feeling like the love she offers is similar to being in a real family . \\nthen again , perhaps its not so different from real families at all . \\neddie adams , who later takes on the screen name \" dirk diggler \" , is skillfully acted by former pop-star , mark wahlberg . \\ni say \" former \" pop star because with this performance wahlberg can officially quit his day job . \\nthis is bold and brave territory for such a young man . \\nhe pulls it off marvelously . \\nwahlberg is a \" big , bright star \" with a big bright future . \\nboogie nights plays very much in the spirit of the people versus larry flynt , without the first amendment preachiness . \\nits intimate studies of character make it the superior film . \\nwahlberg\\'s surprising performance is on par with woody harrelson\\'s . \\nbut in my opinion , boogie nights , is not the best film of the year . \\ni got the feeling that itus 2 1/2 hour running time could have been cut by 15 or 20 minutes without losing any of its resonance . \\nstill , if the subject matter of this film intimidates you , thereus no doubt that once you start watching boogie nights you may still feel like its not your thing , but youull find yourself grooving to it anyway . . . ya \\nknow , kinda like disco . \\n',\n",

              " 'here\\'s a word analogy : amistad is to the lost world as schindler\\'s list is to jurassic park . \\nin 1993 , after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit , many critics described schindler\\'s list as the director\\'s \" penance \" ( as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowd-pleasing blockbuster ) . \\nnow , after a three-year layoff , spielberg is back with a vengeance . \\nonce again , his summer release was special effects-loaded action/adventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers . \\nnow , following his 1993 pattern , he has fashioned another serious , inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity . \\nthat film is amistad . \\nalthough not as masterful as schindler\\'s list , amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture . \\nthematically rich , impeccably crafted , and intellectually stimulating , the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact . \\nwatching schindler\\'s list was a powerful , almost spiritual , experience . \\nspielberg pulled us into the narrative , absorbed us in the drama , then finally let us go , exhausted and shattered , three-plus hours later . \\naspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since . \\namistad , while a fine example of film making , is not as transcendent . \\nthe incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books , but , considering who writes the texts , that\\'s not a surprise . \\nhowever , the event is a part of the american social and legal fabric , and , while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account , most of the basic facts are in order . \\nseveral , mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film\\'s dramatic force . \\non the whole , while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation , it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired . \\none stormy night during the summer of 1839 , the 53 men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape . \\nled by the lion-hearted cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , they take control of the vessel , killing most of the crew . \\nadrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa , they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey . \\nthey are tricked , however , and the la amistad , which makes its way northward off the united states\\' eastern coastline , is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut . \\nthe kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison , charged with murder and piracy . \\nthe first men to come to the africans\\' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) . \\nthey are soon joined by roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a property attorney of little repute . \\naided by advice from former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) , baldwin proves a more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for , and his central argument -- that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men , not property -- convinces the judge . \\nbut powerful forces have aligned against baldwin\\'s cause . \\ncurrent president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , eager to please southern voters and 11-year old queen isabella of spain ( anna paquin ) , begins pulling strings behind-the-scenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free . \\nat its heart , amistad is a tale of human courage . \\ncinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected to . \\nhe is a free man , not a slave , and , while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle , he will not give it up . \\neffectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou , whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention , cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies . \\nthey are individuals , and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movie\\'s success . \\nto amplify this point , spielberg presents many scenes from the africans\\' point-of-view , detailing their occasionally-humorous observations about some of the white man\\'s seemingly-strange \" rituals \" . \\nthe larger struggle is , of course , one of defining humanity . \\nas the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as \" sub-human , \" so the pro-slavery forces of amistad use a similar defense . \\nthe abolitionists regard the africans as men , but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property . \\nin a sense , the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war , which would break out less than three decades later , looming over everything . \\namistad\\'s presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating , making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history . \\nfour claimants come forward against the africans : the state , which wants them tried for murder ; the queen of spain , who wants them handed over to her under the provision of an american/spanish treaty ; two american naval officers , who claim the right of high seas salvage ; and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad , who demand that their property be returned to them . \\nbaldwin must counter all of these claims , while facing a challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with cinque . \\neven though attorney and client are divided by a language barrier , they gradually learn to communicate . \\naside from cinque , who is a fully-realized individual , characterization is spotty , but the acting is top-notch . \\nmatthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his \" pretty boy \" image to become baldwin , but the lawyer is never particularly well-defined outside of his role in the la amistad case . \\nlikewise , while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson and tappan , they are never anything more than \" abolitionists . \" \\nnigel hawthorne , who played the title character in the madness of king george , presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election . \\nfinally , there\\'s anthony hopkins , whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done . \\nhopkins , who can convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer , an emotionally-crippled english butler , and richard nixon , makes us believe that he is adams . \\nhis ten-minute speech about freedom and human values is unforgettable . \\none point of difference worth noting between amistad and schindler\\'s list is this film\\'s lack of a well-defined human villain . \\nschindler\\'s list had ralph fiennes\\' superbly-realized amon goeth , who was not only a three-dimensional character , but a personification of all that the nazis stood for . \\nthere is no such figure in amistad . \\nthe villain is slavery , but an ideology , no matter how evil , is rarely the best adversary . \\nit is to spielberg\\'s credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist . \\namistad\\'s trek to the screen , which encountered some choppy waters ( author barbara chase-riboud has cried plagiarism , a charge denied by the film makers ) , comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident . \\nan opera of the same name opened in chicago on november 29 , 1997 . \\nnumerous books about the subject are showing up on bookstore shelves . \\nit remains to be seen how much longevity the amistad phenomena has , but one thing is certain -- with spielberg\\'s rousing , substantive film leading the way , the spotlight has now illuminated this chapter of american history . \\n',\n",

one should start each day considering oneself as dead . \\nliving atop an abandoned building , surrounded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons , ghost dog exists in a netherworld lacking creature comforts and friends . \\nhe craves nothing more . \\nas he puts it late in the film , \" i\\'ve seen all i want to see . \" \\nhe exists in a spiritual world of the mind , gaining moral sustenance from his readings . \\nghost dog wasn\\'t always as he is presented . \\nin several roshomon-like flashbacks , it\\'s shown how ghost dog was assaulted by racist white males and beaten nearly to death until the timely intervention of a good samaritan , that \" samaritan \" being a foot soldier in an aging crime family . \\nghost dog pledges his life to the service of the man , louie ( tormey ) , as repayment . \\nafter years of loyal service , ghost dog is sent , by louie , to kill \" handsome frank \" , a made man within louie\\'s organization who has run away with the crime boss\\'s daughter , louise ( vessey ) . \\nghost dog wordlessly executes his task , witnessed by louise , whom he spares , as she sits watching a betty boop cartoon , clutching a copy of the book , roshomon . \\nin a bit of synchronicity , louise loans the book to ghost dog . \\nupset that frank was taken out by someone not from the family , the mob bosses , in turn , put out a hit on ghost dog in a perverse twist of loyalty to their assassinated comrade . \\nthe rest of movie holds the dated value systems of both the mafia and ghost dog up to the light of a new millennium with many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into conflict . \\nthe theme of old cartoons flares up time and again , each time showing cartoon violence that is in sharp counterpoint to the reality of ghost dog\\'s world . \\neach time a character is shown watching a cartoon , it\\'s from the same era , betty boop , felix the cat , etc . , a reflection of days gone by . \\nnear the end , louise is watching a cartoon that\\'s a departure from the previously shown ones . \\nit\\'s a bit of audacity on jarmusch\\'s part that is nicely effective , despite it\\'s surrealistic nature . \\nas ghost dog floats through his world , his life is touched by two people . \\none is a sage little girl ( winbush ) who connects with ghost dog through their love of reading . \\nshe comes to symbolize a melding of the old ways and new sensibilities , just as louise ultimately does . \\nby film\\'s end , the fact that jamusch is so effective at illustrating the tenuous bond between the two is a testament to his skill as a writer . \\nthe other person in ghost dog\\'s world is an ice cream ( de bankole\\' ) vendor who only speaks french , yet intuitively shares a rapport with ghost dog . \\nthe vendor is the literal stranger in a strange land . \\njarmusch , through rapper/composer rza , underscores his film with rap and reggae music , which at first blush seems dichotomous , but its primal rhythms serve to strengthen the fundamental nature of the movie . \\nghost dog seems to draw some type of strength from the rap music he listens to as he negotiates the streets in various stolen cars . \\n ( which , in and of itself , presents another paradox about ghost\\'s dog\\'s sense of honor . ) \\nthe head mafioso is played by henry silva with a stone faced resignation . \\nof all the cartoonish mobsters , he is the only one who appears self aware of his state in the world . \\ngorman plays sonny , a lieutenant who respects the old ways , yet has a quirky affinity for rap music , a love comically shown in several impromptu displays . \\nruffini seems the truest reflection of the mafia . \\nhe is a husk of a man , assisted by two hearing aids , who barks out advice without truly hearing what he , or others are saying . \\nwhitaker carries the film by using what truly great actor\\'s use , his face . \\nghost dog is reticent to speak , often going for long periods without doing so . \\nthe fact that whitaker can convey such a wide range of emotion through a gesture or look is a remarkable talent . \\nalthough the film has a deliberate pace , some of the late night drives and walks taken by ghost dog dragged the momentum down . \\ntruly tragic is how ghost dog misinterprets japanese honor in his final confrontation with the mob . \\nhe reveals himself to be so desperate for spiritual guidance through the hagakure that he fails to truly adapt it to what is real and true in his world . \\ncarried on the shoulders of a remarkable performance by whitaker , ghost dog rises beyond being a characterization or icon , into a figure that garners sympathy , if not a bit of pity . \\n',\n",

diverted by other thoughts . \\n \" the ghost in the darkness , \" which opened a few months ago , is a film that s action was so bland and uninvolving , it not only invited my thoughts to divert me , it nearly put me asleep . \\nbut \" metro \" is one of the best action films in a while . \\nit is hip , sharp , nifty , and has nice little pieces of suspense and comedy . \\neddie murphy was in bad shape for a while . \\nand this invites me to mention last year s \" the nutty professor , \" which was his blessed revival back to the position at which he used to be . \\n \" metro \" happens to be a lot better than any film in the \" beverly hills cop \" series . \\nthat is because \" metro \" takes itself seriously , but doesn t prevent itself from having a little fun . \\neddie murphy is at his best in the roles of responsible , and controlled people . \\nthe \" beverly hills cop \" movies all featured eddie as a reckless , wild cop , always crossing the line by just an inch . \\nin \" metro \" he plays a hostage negotiator , so negotiation is his job , not his hobby or his preferred way out of trouble . \\nhis character in \" metro \" takes himself seriously . \\neddie murphy s mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere to be found in \" metro , \" and perhaps it is quite better off that way . \\nmurphy plays scott roper , and as i previously mentioned , he is a san francisco hostage negotiator . \\nin the first tense situation in the film , we are introduced to roper s kind of work , as he tries to calm down a confused , unkempt young criminal who has taken captive the entire capacity of the san francisco bank he is holding up . \\nmurphy handles the scene seriously , without his usual happy-go-lucky , misfit humor . \\nthe film develops when its villain is established , and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda , a jewel thief , and murderer who likes to let cops know of his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of the victim . \\n \" metro \" takes different twists and slight turns , and there is one great , virtuoso chase scene , involving the a cable car . \\ncars flip . \\ncars crash . \\ncars turn over . \\nand it is done so good in this film , i was reminded of \" speed , \" and the speeding bus that couldn t go under fifty mile per hour for very significant reasons . \\nthere are also some other good scenes in \" metro \" that a lot of films would rather choose not to have . \\nscenes like the one with roper and his new partner are at the horse track roper is a gambler who knows all the tricks and roper teaches his partner a few little methods of betting and winning . \\nof course , the writers tried to disguise the scene as being insignificant by having roper draw parallels between hostage negotiation and gambling . \\nthe scenes between roper and his girlfriend are nice , too . \\nthose are the scenes that make up \" metro , \" which is mainly about eddie murphy s maturing as a personality . \\nthe actor that i most enjoyed seeing in \" metro \" was michael rapaport , who plays roper s new partner , a lip-reading , book-skimming genius , and a master of observation . \\nit was not the actor s presence that pleased me as much as the role he was cast in the role of a proclaimed genius . \\nrapaport is an actor who i usually see in the role of the dimwit the really , really dopey dimwit . \\ni hardly recognized him in \" metro , \" and it was quite a joy to be able to see him in a role like this i feel that i respect him more . \\nthere are two main types of villains in movies like this : the ones that are part of the story , and the ones that are devices . \\nthe villain in \" metro \" is no more than a device , but he is a darn good villain nonetheless . \\nhe is played by michael wincott , whose voice is pushed out in a abraded rasp , as if he smokes a cigarette between every take . \\nwincott makes his villain , korda , as mean as could be , the classic type of villain who would push an old lady down a flight of stairs just for kicks , like richard widmark in \" kiss of death . \" \\nand , in addition , wincott s physical appearance and mannerisms , in the film , actually reminded my of an arrogant friend i use to have , who is no longer on my good list . \\ni liked \" metro , \" and i do not think would have worked with any other actor but eddie murphy . \\nhis past roles were the great ones but they were also a precursor to the maturing that would later take place , possibly from murphy s growing as a person , now having a family . \\n \" metro \" is a no-nonsense movie . \\nit works as a buddy movie , which it does not overplay . \\nit works as a dry comedy , which it does not overplay . \\nit works as a suspense film , which it does not overplay . \\nand it works as an action film , where it does have a tendency to occasionally go all-out . \\nbut who cares ? \\nit still remains serious , and it does not overdo itself . \\noh , and there were plenty of explosions in \" metro , \" as well . \\nhow nice it was of the filmmakers to give us those . \\nif there is one major objection i had to \" metro \" , it was the length , an area where a lot of action films seem to wear out their welcomes . \\n \" metro \" is a film that lasted a little too long , but it was still entertaining , and it gave me something to do while i waited

george is simple and doesn\\'t understand bacon in the least , especially not his paintings . \\nwhile watching this , that\\'s basically all i thought was there . \\nthe film has a hypnotic feel , free of any restraints of form , and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about . \\nonce the film is over , it\\'s easier to piece it together . \\ni kept on thinking about this film , wondering what the point to all of it was . \\nsomeone doesn\\'t merely make a film of all style and no substance at all , and if they do , they do it by accident , but still allow some substance to creep in . \\nthinking about it , i remembered how the two fed off of eachother . \\ni thought about how bacon was a masochist , in love with cruelty ( in one scene , he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight , and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxer\\'s head splashes across his face ; in another scene , he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisenstein\\'s \" battleship potemkin \" ) , and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain . \\nhe drove him over the edge , and for him that was love , even if it wasn\\'t for george . \\ni guess that explains the title . \\na bit . \\nthat\\'s great and all , but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning . \\ni wish it hadn\\'t reduced itself to making some point about humanity , about how love is the most selfish thing in the world ( and it is , if you look at it a certain way ) . \\nor maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one man\\'s twisted pysche . \\nit\\'s almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one man\\'s uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audience\\'s throat . \\nthat way you don\\'t reduce your film to something it\\'s just not . \\ni can\\'t say i totally enjoyed \" love is the devil , \" though . \\ndespite all of the things i respect about this movie , it\\'s still rather uncomfortable to sit through . \\neven at a normally trite length of ninety minutes , the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through , especially after an exhausting first hour . \\nthough hypnotic , it still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times , as if it were taking advantage of one man\\'s truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper with it . \\nas such , i respect the way the film looks . \\nit\\'s beautiful and painstakingly crafted so that , along with \" what dreams may come \" and \" dark city , \" it\\'s the year\\'s most visually stunning film . \\nin fact , if a better script had been forged , i\\'d almost compare it in visual power to a peter greenaway film , complete with similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever . \\nand with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi , it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs . \\ni just wish it had been more than mostly style and just a hair bit of substance . \\nthen i would have had something to hold me over even now . \\n',\n",

exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts \" - excerpt from as you like it , act ii , scene 7 \\nwhen william shakespeare penned this passage , he could not have possibly envisioned a world in which the domestic activites in an abode would be broadcast across the continent , or where women would install webcams in their apartments in order to convert voyeurism into cash . \\nthis is the world of today , and it is the perfect climate to unveil a prototypical high-concept project like the truman show . \\ntruman burbank ( jim carrey ) seems to have the perfect life . \\nhe has a pretty , doting wife meryl ( laura linney ) , a comfortable insurance sales position , an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island community of seahaven , a reliable childhood buddy marlon ( noah emmerich ) -- except for the dog that paws a greeting to him every morning and his hydrophobia , this is paradise . \\nor so it would seem . \\nbizarre , inexplicable incidents begin to crop up in truman\\'s life . \\na lighting fixture unexpectedly plummets from the sky . \\na rainstorm which gives new meaning to the term \\'isolated\\' follows him around . \\na radio broadcast appears to be describing his every move . \\nfor the first time in his life , it is beginning to dawn on truman that things are not what they appear to be . \\nthe truman show , directed by peter weir and written by andrew niccol , is a remarkably well-constructed film , paced perfectly with every scene fluidly leading into the next . \\nbalancing drama with humour , thoughtfulness with abandon , this is a film which addresses an intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of sermonizing and whimsical fancy . \\nin many ways , mr . niccol\\'s screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous gattaca -- both films focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity , with pivotal , character-defining moments occurring at sea . \\nalthough the film\\'s rather conventional climax doesn\\'t sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first two-thirds , and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch , there are moments through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception . \\ndespite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film , it remains foremost a finely-crafted piece of entertainment , constantly light and accessible . \\nthe tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude , and as the carefully-stacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down , the film eschews any psychological ramifications for a man discovering that the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false . \\nthe end act of the truman show essentially boils down to a rehash of the reliable , crowdpleasing underdog vs . \\nthe system formula . \\nwhile the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept , some elements are lacking . \\nthe device of mysterious lauren/sylvia ( natascha mcelhone ) as a contributing impetus to truman\\'s growing awareness isn\\'t exactly convincing . \\nthere\\'s not much of a discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves , and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff ( ed harris ) with regards to the moral ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the audience , thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film . \\nin fact , although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes depicting the real world outside truman\\'s artificial utopia to a mere handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers , it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even * more * deeply in the insulatory seahaven world , with the resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling . \\nstill , the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target , and its insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright anti-voyeuristic tirades such as that of the recent costa gavras film mad city . \\ni\\'ve always believed that the versatile ms . linney possesses a tremendous comic gift -- she has always seems to have a impish gleam in her eyes -- and in the truman show she runs rampant with her duplicitous character , mischievously flashing a glazed , insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans . \\ncheerfully going over the top , it\\'s hilarious to watch her -- who would have ever guessed that she\\'d have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laughs department of a film ? \\nms . linney is a delight in the film . \\nbut it is mr . carrey who rules the show here . \\nhe may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank -- the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interludes which typify his traditional parts -- but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal : it\\'s difficult not to root for truman . \\nin a commanding performance , mr . carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes him a genuinely engaging presence , and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn , demonstrating admirable restraint -- there\\'s an early scene where he\\'s down on his knees gardening , and given his past track record , one almost instinctively anticipates mr . carrey to pull one of more infamous , and in this case , wholly inappropriate sight gags . \\nit\\'s almost poetic how this notorious look-at-me actor successfully tones it down to play a character who\\'s constantly the centre of attention . \\nin addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast -- mr . emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness -- the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating truman\\'s antiseptic , white picket-fenced smalltown utopia , and by burkhard dallwitz\\'s original score . \\ntechnical credits are first-rate all around . \\nwhile the truman show is clearly a definitive high-concept film , it\\'s not exactly a dazzlingly innovative one -- obvious predecessors utilising common elements abound , ranging from 1965\\'s secret agent through to the groundbreaking british 1967 tv series the prisoner . \\nall the same , this is a visionary , award-calibre film : entertaining , provocative , and intelligent . \\nthe curious ( and possibly disturbing ) thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the film\\'s concept seems unfathomably outrageous , it\\'s abundantly clear that our society is rapidly approaching , if not actualisation , at least permissiveness of such a scenario . \\nperhaps the highest compliment which can be paid to mr . weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing that we accept it without question . \\nperhaps we recognize a bit of ourselves in this world . \\n',\n",

              " ' \" six days , seven nights \" is a summer movie that gets the summer movie experience deliciously right , a commendable achievement considering the season thus far has been littered with some pretty uneven fare . \\nhere\\'s a genuinely fun fluff piece that knows it\\'s fluff , recognizes it\\'s fluff and is admittedly proud to be fluff . \\nof course , the casting of harrison ford in the broadly comedic lead role plays a sizeable part in the movie\\'s success ; ford is such a concentrated dramatic actor that it\\'s easy to forget what a funny guy he can be . \\nas his female counterpart , anne heche also deserves a big pat on the back for her sweet , goofily charismatic performance . \\nthe age difference ( ford\\'s 56 , heche\\'s 29 ) matters not -- these two click in a charged way that\\'s hard to come by . \\nthe story is a no-brainer -- ford stars as gruff but loveable island aviator quinn harris , while heche is career-minded but loveable new york magazine editor robin monroe . \\nrobin , on a tropical vacation with fianc ? frank ( david schwimmer ) , gets assigned to supervise an emergency photo shoot in nearby tahiti , so she reluctantly hires quinn to fly her there . \\nthe plane crashes during a terrible storm , and they immediately find themselves stuck in a deserted paradise with few ideas on getting back to civilization . \\na series of unpleasant , often hilarious catastrophes leaves little choice but for both members of this unlikely odd couple to fall for each other . \\nmeanwhile , back at the resort , frank is tempted himself by quinn\\'s shapely female tagalong ( jacqueline obradors ) . \\nthat subplot obviously exists to get us rooting for the quinn-robin pairing , and while it makes for a few good laughs early on , it eventually becomes a contrived distraction from the far more engrossing misadventures of quinn and robin . \\nand since the film spends most of its time with the castaways , this flaw is only a minor inconvenience . \\ndirector ivan reitman keeps the pace brisk . \\nat a slim 101 minutes , \" six days , seven nights \" never wears out its welcome , where a lesser film could have felt like it was as long as its title . \\nmichael browning\\'s clever screenplay allows for plenty of notable one-liners ( my favorite , taken in context , is \" you mean _arrrgh_ pirates ? \" ) , and though it essentially boils down to one mishap after another , they\\'re all quite engaging . \\neven the movie\\'s more \" serious \" moments are played with a wink . \\nheche has been under undeserved fire over whether or not her private life with ellen degeneres would affect the \" believability \" of \" six days , seven nights \" \\' heterosexual pairing . \\n ( so she\\'s a lesbian . \\nso what . \\ndeal with it . ) \\nof course it doesn\\'t , and here , her naysayers are proved wrong in a big way . \\nin fact , her chemistry with ford is what really makes the film click ; these opposites attract with the utmost , endearing electricity . \\nat one point , when the two are discussing the likelihood of romantic interest , heche asks ford how old he is . \\nafter several wrong guesses ( \" forty-five ? \\n_fifty_ ? \" ) , he whispers his age to her . \\n \" you still look good , \" heche stammers . \\n \" i still _am_ good , \" ford replies . \\nshe\\'s good too , and together , they make \" six days , seven nights \" one memorable ride . \\n',\n",
